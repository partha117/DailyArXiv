| **[The Integration of Agile Methodologies in DevOps Practices within the Information Technology Industry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21811v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The demand for rapid software delivery in the Information Technology (IT) industry has significantly intensified, emphasising the need for faster software products and service releases with enhanced features to meet customer expectations. Agile methodologies are replacing traditional approaches such as Waterfall, where flexibility, iterative development and adaptation to change are favoured over rigid planning and execution. DevOps, a subsequent evolution from Agile, emphasises collaborative efforts in development and operations teams, focusing on continuous integration and deployment to deliver resilient and high-quality software products and services. This study aims to critically assess both Agile and DevOps practices in the IT industry to identify the feasibility and applicability of Agile methods in DevOps practices. Eleven semi-structured interviews were conducted with Agile and DevOps practitioners in varying capacities across several sectors within the IT industry. Through thematic analysis, 51 unique codes were extracted and synthesised into 19 themes that reported on each phase of the DevOps lifecycle, specifically regarding the integration and implementation of Agile methods into DevOps practices. Based on the findings, a new understanding detailing the interrelationship of Agile methods in DevOps practices was discussed that met the research objectives.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 2 figures, conference</p></details> |

| **[Detecting Stealthy Data Poisoning Attacks in AI Code Generators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21636v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning (DL) models for natural language-to-code generation have become integral to modern software development pipelines. However, their heavy reliance on large amounts of data, often collected from unsanitized online sources, exposes them to data poisoning attacks, where adversaries inject malicious samples to subtly bias model behavior. Recent targeted attacks silently replace secure code with semantically equivalent but vulnerable implementations without relying on explicit triggers to launch the attack, making it especially hard for detection methods to distinguish clean from poisoned samples. We present a systematic study on the effectiveness of existing poisoning detection methods under this stealthy threat model. Specifically, we perform targeted poisoning on three DL models (CodeBERT, CodeT5+, AST-T5), and evaluate spectral signatures analysis, activation clustering, and static analysis as defenses. Our results show that all methods struggle to detect triggerless poisoning, with representation-based approaches failing to isolate poisoned samples and static analysis suffering false positives and false negatives, highlighting the need for more robust, trigger-independent defenses for AI-assisted code generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 3rd IEEE International Workshop on Reliable and Secure AI for Software Engineering (ReSAISE, 2025), co-located with ISSRE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Human-Written vs. AI-Generated Code: A Large-Scale Study of Defects, Vulnerabilities, and Complexity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21634v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI code assistants become increasingly integrated into software development workflows, understanding how their code compares to human-written programs is critical for ensuring reliability, maintainability, and security. In this paper, we present a large-scale comparison of code authored by human developers and three state-of-the-art LLMs, i.e., ChatGPT, DeepSeek-Coder, and Qwen-Coder, on multiple dimensions of software quality: code defects, security vulnerabilities, and structural complexity. Our evaluation spans over 500k code samples in two widely used languages, Python and Java, classifying defects via Orthogonal Defect Classification and security vulnerabilities using the Common Weakness Enumeration. We find that AI-generated code is generally simpler and more repetitive, yet more prone to unused constructs and hardcoded debugging, while human-written code exhibits greater structural complexity and a higher concentration of maintainability issues. Notably, AI-generated code also contains more high-risk security vulnerabilities. These findings highlight the distinct defect profiles of AI- and human-authored code and underscore the need for specialized quality assurance practices in AI-assisted programming.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 36th IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE, 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Reusable Test Suites for Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21553v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) agents show great promise in solving sequential decision-making tasks. However, validating the reliability and performance of the agent policies' behavior for deployment remains challenging. Most reinforcement learning policy testing methods produce test suites tailored to the agent policy being tested, and their relevance to other policies is unclear. This work presents Multi-Policy Test Case Selection (MPTCS), a novel automated test suite selection method for RL environments, designed to extract test cases generated by any policy testing framework based on their solvability, diversity, and general difficulty. MPTCS uses a set of policies to select a diverse collection of reusable policy-agnostic test cases that reveal typical flaws in the agents' behavior. The set of policies selects test cases from a candidate pool, which can be generated by any policy testing method, based on a difficulty score. We assess the effectiveness of the difficulty score and how the method's effectiveness and cost depend on the number of policies in the set. Additionally, a method for promoting diversity in the test suite, a discretized general test case descriptor surface inspired by quality-diversity algorithms, is examined to determine how it covers the state space and which policies it triggers to produce faulty behaviors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Semantic Understanding in Pointer Analysis using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21454v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pointer analysis has been studied for over four decades. However, existing frameworks continue to suffer from the propagation of incorrect facts. A major limitation stems from their insufficient semantic understanding of code, resulting in overly conservative treatment of user-defined functions. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) present new opportunities to bridge this gap. In this paper, we propose LMPA (LLM-enhanced Pointer Analysis), a vision that integrates LLMs into pointer analysis to enhance both precision and scalability. LMPA identifies user-defined functions that resemble system APIs and models them accordingly, thereby mitigating erroneous cross-calling-context propagation. Furthermore, it enhances summary-based analysis by inferring initial points-to sets and introducing a novel summary strategy augmented with natural language. Finally, we discuss the key challenges involved in realizing this vision.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by LMPL 2025</p></details> |
| **[The Complexity Trap: Simple Observation Masking Is as Efficient as LLM Summarization for Agent Context Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21433v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents solve complex tasks through iterative reasoning, exploration, and tool-use, a process that can result in long, expensive context histories. While state-of-the-art Software Engineering ( SE) agents like OpenHands or Cursor use LLM-based summarization to tackle this issue, it is unclear whether the increased complexity offers tangible performance benefits compared to simply omitting older observations. We present a systematic comparison of these strategies within SWE-agent on SWE-bench Verified across five diverse model configurations. We find that a simple observation-masking strategy halves cost relative to a raw agent while matching, and sometimes slightly exceeding, the solve rate of LLM summarization. For example, with Qwen3-Coder 480B, masking improves solve rate from 53.8% (raw agent) to 54.8%, while remaining competitive with summarization at a lower cost. These results suggest that, at least within SWE-agent on SWE-bench Verified, the most effective and efficient context management can be the simplest. We release code and data for reproducibility</p></details> |  |
| **[RepoMark: A Code Usage Auditing Framework for Code Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21432v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation has transformed software development by automating coding tasks with unprecedented efficiency. However, the training of these models on open-source code repositories (e.g., from GitHub) raises critical ethical and legal concerns, particularly regarding data authorization and open-source license compliance. Developers are increasingly questioning whether model trainers have obtained proper authorization before using repositories for training, especially given the lack of transparency in data collection. To address these concerns, we propose a novel data marking framework RepoMark to audit the data usage of code LLMs. Our method enables repository owners to verify whether their code has been used in training, while ensuring semantic preservation, imperceptibility, and theoretical false detection rate (FDR) guarantees. By generating multiple semantically equivalent code variants, RepoMark introduces data marks into the code files, and during detection, RepoMark leverages a novel ranking-based hypothesis test to detect memorization within the model. Compared to prior data auditing approaches, RepoMark significantly enhances sample efficiency, allowing effective auditing even when the user's repository possesses only a small number of code files. Experiments demonstrate that RepoMark achieves a detection success rate over 90\% on small code repositories under a strict FDR guarantee of 5\%. This represents a significant advancement over existing data marking techniques, all of which only achieve accuracy below 55\% under identical settings. This further validates RepoMark as a robust, theoretically sound, and promising solution for enhancing transparency in code LLM training, which can safeguard the rights of repository owners.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Study of Vulnerable Package Dependencies in LLM Repositories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21417v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have developed rapidly in recent years, revolutionizing various fields. Despite their widespread success, LLMs heavily rely on external code dependencies from package management systems, creating a complex and interconnected LLM dependency supply chain. Vulnerabilities in dependencies can expose LLMs to security risks. While existing research predominantly focuses on model-level security threats, vulnerabilities within the LLM dependency supply chain have been overlooked. To fill this gap, we conducted an empirical analysis of 52 open-source LLMs, examining their third-party dependencies and associated vulnerabilities. We then explored activities within the LLM repositories to understand how maintainers manage third-party vulnerabilities in practice. Finally, we compared third-party dependency vulnerabilities in the LLM ecosystem to those in the Python ecosystem. Our results show that half of the vulnerabilities in the LLM ecosystem remain undisclosed for more than 56.2 months, significantly longer than those in the Python ecosystem. Additionally, 75.8% of LLMs include vulnerable dependencies in their configuration files. This study advances the understanding of LLM supply chain risks, provides insights for practitioners, and highlights potential directions for improving the security of the LLM supply chain.</p></details> |  |

| **[Locus: Agentic Predicate Synthesis for Directed Fuzzing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21302v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Directed fuzzing aims to find program inputs that lead to specified target program states. It has broad applications, such as debugging system crashes, confirming reported bugs, and generating exploits for potential vulnerabilities. This task is inherently challenging because target states are often deeply nested in the program, while the search space manifested by numerous possible program inputs is prohibitively large. Existing approaches rely on branch distances or manually-specified constraints to guide the search; however, the branches alone are often insufficient to precisely characterize progress toward reaching the target states, while the manually specified constraints are often tailored for specific bug types and thus difficult to generalize to diverse target states and programs. We present Locus, a novel framework to improve the efficiency of directed fuzzing. Our key insight is to synthesize predicates to capture fuzzing progress as semantically meaningful intermediate states, serving as milestones towards reaching the target states. When used to instrument the program under fuzzing, they can reject executions unlikely to reach the target states, while providing additional coverage guidance. To automate this task and generalize to diverse programs, Locus features an agentic framework with program analysis tools to synthesize and iteratively refine the candidate predicates, while ensuring the predicates strictly relax the target states to prevent false rejections via symbolic execution. Our evaluation shows that Locus substantially improves the efficiency of eight state-of-the-art fuzzers in discovering real-world vulnerabilities, achieving an average speedup of 41.6x. So far, Locus has found eight previously unpatched bugs, with one already acknowledged with a draft patch.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM as an Execution Estimator: Recovering Missing Dependency for Practical Time-travelling Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18721v4)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose RecovSlicing for computing dynamic data dependency in a single run, with only partial instrumentation. We explore the intuition that LLM can potentially infer program dynamics based on a partially recorded trace and relevant code as its context. Given (1) a partially recorded trace of a program $P$ and (2) the slicing criteria consisting of a query step $s$ and a query variable $v$ read by $s$, RecovSlicing computes the runtime definition of $v$ on the trace by estimating the miss-recorded execution of $P$. In this work, we allow the user to specify implicit query variable, for example, the implicit library variable used in list{\ttfamily .}get(i). Technically, built upon non-deterministic LLM, we address the challenges of (1) precise recovery of runtime variable value and structure from the recorded execution and (2) aligning the memory address of recovered variables and the recorded variables for definition analysis. We extensively evaluate RecovSlicing against the state-of-the-art slicers such as Slicer4J, ND-Slicer, LLM Slicer, and re-execution Slicer on a total number of 8300 data-dependencies over 3 slicing benchmarks. The results show that RecovSlicing can significantly outperform the baselines. The accuracy and recall, achieving 80.3%, 91.1%, and 98.3% on the three benchmarks, whereas the best baseline reaches 39.0%, 82.0%, and 59.9% (accuracy), and 53.4%, 79.1%, and 87.1% (recall), respectively. In addition, we integrate RecovSlicing in a dual-slicing based regression bug localizer, significantly improving its performance by locating 16% more regressions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning Based Concurrency Bug Detection and Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20911v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concurrency bugs, caused by improper synchronization of shared resources in multi-threaded or distributed systems, are notoriously hard to detect and thus compromise software reliability and security. The existing deep learning methods face three main limitations. First, there is an absence of large and dedicated datasets of diverse concurrency bugs for them. Second, they lack sufficient representation of concurrency semantics. Third, binary classification results fail to provide finer-grained debug information such as precise bug lines. To address these problems, we propose a novel method for effective concurrency bug detection as well as localization. We construct a dedicated concurrency bug dataset to facilitate model training and evaluation. We then integrate a pre-trained model with a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN), by incorporating a new Concurrency-Aware Code Property Graph (CCPG) that concisely and effectively characterizes concurrency semantics. To further facilitate debugging, we employ SubgraphX, a GNN-based interpretability method, which explores the graphs to precisely localize concurrency bugs, mapping them to specific lines of source code. On average, our method demonstrates an improvement of 10\% in accuracy and precision and 26\% in recall compared to state-of-the-art methods across diverse evaluation settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoQuIR: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Code Quality-Aware Information Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11066v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code retrieval is essential in modern software development, as it boosts code reuse and accelerates debugging. However, current benchmarks primarily emphasize functional relevance while neglecting critical dimensions of software quality. Motivated by this gap, we introduce CoQuIR, the first large-scale, multilingual benchmark specifically designed to evaluate quality-aware code retrieval across four key dimensions: correctness, efficiency, security, and maintainability. CoQuIR provides fine-grained quality annotations for 42,725 queries and 134,907 code snippets in 11 programming languages, and is accompanied by two quality-centric evaluation metrics: Pairwise Preference Accuracy and Margin-based Ranking Score. Using CoQuIR, we benchmark 23 retrieval models, covering both open-source and proprietary systems, and find that even top-performing models frequently fail to distinguish buggy or insecure code from their more robust counterparts. Furthermore, we conduct preliminary investigations into training methods that explicitly encourage retrievers to recognize code quality. Using synthetic datasets, we demonstrate promising improvements in quality-aware metrics across various models, without sacrificing semantic relevance. Downstream code generation experiments further validate the effectiveness of our approach. Overall, our work highlights the importance of integrating quality signals into code retrieval systems, laying the groundwork for more trustworthy and robust software development tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[PatchTrack: A Comprehensive Analysis of ChatGPT's Influence on Pull Request Outcomes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07700v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT has introduced new dynamics in software development, particularly within pull request workflows. While prior research has examined the quality of AI-generated code, little is known about how developers actually use these suggestions in real-world collaboration. We analyze 338 pull requests from 255 GitHub repositories containing self-admitted ChatGPT usage, including 645 AI-generated snippets and 3,486 developer-authored patches. We introduce PatchTrack, a tool that classifies whether ChatGPT patches were applied, not applied, or not suggested, enabling fine-grained analysis of AI-assisted decisions. Full adoption of ChatGPT code is rare: the median integration rate was 25%. A qualitative analysis of 89 pull requests with integrated patches revealed recurring patterns of structural integration, selective extraction, and iterative refinement, showing that developers typically treat ChatGPT's output as a starting point rather than a final implementation. Even when code was not directly adopted, ChatGPT influenced workflows through conceptual guidance, documentation, and debugging strategies. Integration decisions were shaped by scope, architectural fit, contributor role, and review norms. This study offers empirical insight into how generative AI is used in collaborative software development, showing that its impact extends beyond patch generation to broader decision-making. Our findings inform the design of AI-assisted tools, clarify patch adoption behavior, and support more transparent and effective use of LLMs in practice.</p></details> | 53 pages, 8 figures |

Therefore, effective and efficient debugging is one of the core skills a software engineer must develop. However, the teaching of debugging techniques is usually very limited or only taught in indirect ways, e.g., during software projects. As a result, most Computer Science (CS) students learn debugging only in an ad-hoc and unstructured way. In this work, we present our approach called Simulated Interactive Debugging that interactively guides students along the debugging process. The guidance aims to empower the students to repair their solutions and have a proper learning experience. We envision that such guided debugging techniques can be integrated into programming courses early in the CS education curriculum. We developed a prototypical implementation using traditional fault localization techniques and large language models. Students can use features like the automated setting of breakpoints or an interactive chatbot. We designed and executed a small-scale, controlled experiment with eight undergraduate CS students. Based on the responses, we conclude that the participants liked the systematic guidance. They rated the automated setting of breakpoints as most effective, followed by the interactive debugging and chatting, and the breakpoint explanations. In future, we will extend our concept and implementation, and perform more intensive user studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the NIER track of the 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, ASE-NIER 2025</p></details> |

Monitoring through logging a long-standing practice in traditional software offers a potential means for auditing ML applications, as logs provide traceable records of system behavior useful for debugging, performance analysis, and continuous auditing. systematically auditing models for compliance or accountability. The findings underscore the need for enhanced logging practices and tooling that systematically integrate responsible AI metrics. Such practices would support the development of auditable, transparent, and ethically responsible ML systems, aligning with growing regulatory requirements and societal expectations. By highlighting specific deficiencies and opportunities, this work provides actionable guidance for both practitioners and tool developers seeking to strengthen the accountability and trustworthiness of ML applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[What Did I Do Wrong? Quantifying LLMs' Sensitivity and Consistency to Prompt Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12334v4)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) changed the way we design and interact with software systems. Their ability to process and extract information from text has drastically improved productivity in a number of routine tasks. Developers that want to include these models in their software stack, however, face a dreadful challenge: debugging LLMs' inconsistent behavior across minor variations of the prompt. We therefore introduce two metrics for classification tasks, namely sensitivity and consistency, which are complementary to task performance. First, sensitivity measures changes of predictions across rephrasings of the prompt, and does not require access to ground truth labels. Instead, consistency measures how predictions vary across rephrasings for elements of the same class. We perform an empirical comparison of these metrics on text classification tasks, using them as guideline for understanding failure modes of the LLM. Our hope is that sensitivity and consistency will be helpful to guide prompt engineering and obtain LLMs that balance robustness with performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the Annual Conference of the Nations of the Americas Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (NAACL 2025)</p></details> |
| **[ARSP: Automated Repair of Verilog Designs via Semantic Partitioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16517v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging functional Verilog bugs consumes a significant portion of front-end design time. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in mitigating this effort, existing LLM-based automated debugging methods underperform on industrial-scale modules. A major reason for this is bug signal dilution in long contexts, where a few bug-relevant tokens are overwhelmed by hundreds of unrelated lines, diffusing the model's attention. To address this issue, we introduce ARSP, a two-stage system that mitigates dilution via semantics-guided fragmentation. A Partition LLM splits a module into semantically tight fragments; a Repair LLM patches each fragment; edits are merged without altering unrelated logic. A synthetic data framework generates fragment-level training pairs spanning bug types, design styles, and scales to supervise both models. Experiments show that ARSP achieves 77.92% pass@1 and 83.88% pass@5, outperforming mainstream commercial LLMs including Claude-3.7 and SOTA automated Verilog debugging tools Strider and MEIC. Also, semantic partitioning improves pass@1 by 11.6% and pass@5 by 10.2% over whole-module debugging, validating the effectiveness of fragment-level scope reduction in LLM-based Verilog debugging.</p></details> |  |

Still in its infancy, large language model (LLM)-based proof generation lags behind LLM-based code generation. In this paper, we present AutoVerus. AutoVerus uses LLMs to automatically generate correctness proof for Rust code. AutoVerus is designed to match the unique features of Verus, a verification tool that can prove the correctness of Rust code using proofs and specifications also written in Rust. AutoVerus consists of a network of LLM agents that are crafted and orchestrated to mimic human experts' three phases of proof construction: preliminary proof generation, proof refinement guided by generic tips, and proof debugging guided by verification errors. To thoroughly evaluate AutoVerus and help foster future research in this direction, we have built a benchmark suite of 150 non-trivial proof tasks, based on existing code-generation benchmarks and verification benchmarks. Our evaluation shows that AutoVerus can automatically generate correct proof for more than 90% of them, with more than half of them tackled in less than 30 seconds or 3 LLM calls.</p></details> | OOPSLA 2025 |

Yet, their real-world effectiveness in detecting diverse software bugs, particularly complex, security-relevant vulnerabilities, remains underexplored. This study presents a systematic, empirical evaluation of these three leading LLMs using a benchmark of foundational programming errors, classic security flaws, and advanced, production-grade bugs in C++ and Python. The dataset integrates real code from SEED Labs, OpenSSL (via the Suresoft GLaDOS database), and PyBugHive, validated through local compilation and testing pipelines. A novel multi-stage, context-aware prompting protocol simulates realistic debugging scenarios, while a graded rubric measures detection accuracy, reasoning depth, and remediation quality. Our results show that all models excel at identifying syntactic and semantic issues in well-scoped code, making them promising for educational use and as first-pass reviewers in automated code auditing. Performance diminishes in scenarios involving complex security vulnerabilities and large-scale production code, with ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3 generally providing more nuanced contextual analyses than LLaMA 4. This highlights both the promise and the present constraints of LLMs in serving as reliable code analysis tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Generate Unit Tests for Automated Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01619v3)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unit tests (UTs) play an instrumental role in assessing code correctness as well as providing feedback to large language models (LLMs), motivating automated test generation. However, we uncover a trade-off between generating unit test inputs that reveal errors when given a faulty code and correctly predicting the unit test output without access to the gold solution. To address this trade-off, we propose UTGen, which teaches LLMs to generate unit test inputs that reveal errors along with their correct expected outputs based on task descriptions. Since model-generated tests can provide noisy signals (e.g., from incorrectly predicted outputs), we propose UTDebug that (i) scales UTGen via test-time compute to improve UT output prediction, and (ii) validates and backtracks edits based on multiple generated UTs to avoid overfitting, and helps LLMs debug effectively. We show that UTGen outperforms other LLM-based baselines by 7.59% based on a metric measuring the presence of both error-revealing UT inputs and correct UT outputs. When used with UTDebug, we find that feedback from UTGen's unit tests improves pass@1 accuracy of Qwen2.5 32B on HumanEvalFix and our own harder debugging split of MBPP+ by over 3.17% and 12.35% (respectively) over other LLM-based UT generation baselines. Moreover, we observe that feedback from Qwen2.5 32B-based UTGen model can enhance debugging with frontier LLMs like GPT-4o by 13.8%. Lastly, we demonstrate that UTGen is a better judge for code correctness, outperforming a state-of-the-art trained 8B reward model by 4.43% on HumanEval+ with best-of-10 sampling using Qwen2.5 7B.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLM 2025.

Existing agent-based methods often struggle to fully and accurately reproduce implementation details such as mathematical formulas and algorithmic logic. Previous studies show that reflection with explicit feedback improves agent performance. However, current paper reproduction methods fail to effectively adopt this strategy. This gap mainly arises from the diverse paper patterns, complex method modules, and varied configurations encountered in research papers. Motivated by how humans use systematic checklists to efficiently debug complex code, we propose \textbf{RePro}, a \textbf{Re}flective Paper-to-Code \textbf{Repro}duction framework that automatically extracts a paper's fingerprint, referring to a comprehensive set of accurate and atomic criteria serving as high-quality supervisory signals. The framework first generates code based on the extracted information, and then leverages the fingerprint within iterative verification and refinement loop. This approach systematically detects discrepancies and produces targeted revisions to align generated code with the paper's implementation details. Extensive experiments on the PaperBench Code-Dev benchmark have been conducted, RePro achieves 13.0\% performance gap over baselines, and it correctly revises complex logical and mathematical criteria in reflecting, on which the effectiveness is obvious.</p></details> |  |
| **[Post-hoc LLM-Supported Debugging of Distributed Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14540v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we address the problem of manual debugging, which nowadays remains resource-intensive and in some parts archaic. This problem is especially evident in increasingly complex and distributed software systems. Therefore, our objective of this work is to introduce an approach that can possibly be applied to any system, at both the macro- and micro-level, to ease this debugging process. This approach utilizes a system's process data, in conjunction with generative AI, to generate natural-language explanations. These explanations are generated from the actual process data, interface information, and documentation to guide the developers more efficiently to understand the behavior and possible errors of a process and its sub-processes. Here, we present a demonstrator that employs this approach on a component-based Java system. However, our approach is language-agnostic. Ideally, the generated explanations will provide a good understanding of the process, even if developers are not familiar with all the details of the considered system. Our demonstrator is provided as an open-source web application that is freely accessible to all users.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at ICWE 2025, Delft (30 June - 03 July 2025)</p></details> |
| **[AgentSight: System-Level Observability for AI Agents Using eBPF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02736v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern software infrastructure increasingly relies on LLM agents for development and maintenance, such as Claude Code and Gemini-cli. However, these AI agents differ fundamentally from traditional deterministic software, posing a significant challenge to conventional monitoring and debugging. This creates a critical semantic gap: existing tools observe either an agent's high-level intent (via LLM prompts) or its low-level actions (e.g., system calls), but cannot correlate these two views. This blindness makes it difficult to distinguish between benign operations, malicious attacks, and costly failures. We introduce AgentSight, an AgentOps observability framework that bridges this semantic gap using a hybrid approach. Our approach, boundary tracing, monitors agents from outside their application code at stable system interfaces using eBPF. AgentSight intercepts TLS-encrypted LLM traffic to extract semantic intent, monitors kernel events to observe system-wide effects, and causally correlates these two streams across process boundaries using a real-time engine and secondary LLM analysis. This instrumentation-free technique is framework-agnostic, resilient to rapid API changes, and incurs less than 3% performance overhead. Our evaluation shows AgentSight detects prompt injection attacks, identifies resource-wasting reasoning loops, and reveals hidden coordination bottlenecks in multi-agent systems. AgentSight is released as an open-source project at https://github.com/agent-sight/agentsight.</p></details> |  |
| **[Defects4Log: Benchmarking LLMs for Logging Code Defect Detection and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11305v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logging code is written by developers to capture system runtime behavior and plays a vital role in debugging, performance analysis, and system monitoring. However, defects in logging code can undermine the usefulness of logs and lead to misinterpretations. Although prior work has identified several logging defect patterns and provided valuable insights into logging practices, these studies often focus on a narrow range of defect patterns derived from limited sources (e.g., commit histories) and lack a systematic and comprehensive analysis. Moreover, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising generalization and reasoning capabilities across a variety of code-related tasks, yet their potential for detecting logging code defects remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we derive a comprehensive taxonomy of logging code defects, which encompasses seven logging code defect patterns with 14 detailed scenarios. We further construct a benchmark dataset, \dataset, consisting of 164 developer-verified real-world logging defects. Then we propose an automated framework that leverages various prompting strategies and contextual information to evaluate LLMs' capability in detecting and reasoning logging code defects. Experimental results reveal that LLMs generally struggle to accurately detect and reason logging code defects based on the source code only. However, incorporating proper knowledge (e.g., detailed scenarios of defect patterns) can lead to 10.9\% improvement in detection accuracy. Overall, our findings provide actionable guidance for practitioners to avoid common defect patterns and establish a foundation for improving LLM-based reasoning in logging code defect detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniLLP: Enhancing LLM-based Log Level Prediction with Context-Aware Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08545v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developers insert logging statements in source code to capture relevant runtime information essential for maintenance and debugging activities. Log level choice is an integral, yet tricky part of the logging activity as it controls log verbosity and therefore influences systems' observability and performance. Recent advances in ML-based log level prediction have leveraged large language models (LLMs) to propose log level predictors (LLPs) that demonstrated promising performance improvements (AUC between 0.64 and 0.8). Nevertheless, current LLM-based LLPs rely on randomly selected in-context examples, overlooking the structure and the diverse logging practices within modern software projects. In this paper, we propose OmniLLP, a novel LLP enhancement framework that clusters source files based on (1) semantic similarity reflecting the code's functional purpose, and (2) developer ownership cohesion. By retrieving in-context learning examples exclusively from these semantic and ownership aware clusters, we aim to provide more coherent prompts to LLPs leveraging LLMs, thereby improving their predictive accuracy. Our results show that both semantic and ownership-aware clusterings statistically significantly improve the accuracy (by up to 8\% AUC) of the evaluated LLM-based LLPs compared to random predictors (i.e., leveraging randomly selected in-context examples from the whole project). Additionally, our approach that combines the semantic and ownership signal for in-context prediction achieves an impressive 0.88 to 0.96 AUC across our evaluated projects. Our findings highlight the value of integrating software engineering-specific context, such as code semantic and developer ownership signals into LLM-LLPs, offering developers a more accurate, contextually-aware approach to logging and therefore, enhancing system maintainability and observability.</p></details> |  |
| **[CP-Agent: Agentic Constraint Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07468v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Translating natural language problem descriptions into formal constraint models remains a fundamental challenge in constraint programming, requiring deep expertise in both the problem domain and modeling frameworks. Previous approaches to automating this translation have employed fixed workflows with predetermined modeling steps, failing on a significant number of benchmark problems. We present a new approach using a pure agentic strategy without any fixed pipeline. We developed a general-purpose Python coding agent based on the ReAct (Reason and Act) principle, utilizing a persistent IPython kernel for stateful code execution and iterative development. Rather than embedding constraint programming logic into the agent architecture, domain-specific expertise is injected solely through a carefully crafted project prompt. The agent combines this prompt-encoded knowledge with access to file operations and code execution tools, enabling it to test hypotheses, debug failures, and verify solutions dynamically. Implemented in just a few hundred lines of code, this architecture successfully solves all 101 problems of the CP-Bench constraint programming benchmark set. The results suggest that constraint modeling tasks require the combination of general coding tools and domain expertise encoded in prompts, rather than specialized agent architectures or predefined workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[TraceLens: Question-Driven Debugging for Taint Flow Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07198v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Taint analysis is a security analysis technique used to track the flow of potentially dangerous data through an application and its dependent libraries. Investigating why certain unexpected flows appear and why expected flows are missing is an important sensemaking process during end-user taint analysis. Existing taint analysis tools often do not provide this end-user debugging capability, where developers can ask why, why-not, and what-if questions about dataflows and reason about the impact of configuring sources and sinks, and models of 3rd-party libraries that abstract permissible and impermissible data flows. Furthermore, a tree-view or a list-view used in existing taint-analyzer's visualization makes it difficult to reason about the global impact on connectivity between multiple sources and sinks. Inspired by the insight that sensemaking tool-generated results can be significantly improved by a QA inquiry process, we propose TraceLens, a first end-user question-answer style debugging interface for taint analysis. It enables a user to ask why, why-not, and what-if questions to investigate the existence of suspicious flows, the non-existence of expected flows, and the global impact of third-party library models. TraceLens performs speculative what-if analysis, to help a user in debugging how different connectivity assumptions affect overall results. A user study with 12 participants shows that participants using TraceLens achieved 21% higher accuracy on average, compared to CodeQL. They also reported a 45% reduction in mental demand (NASA-TLX) and rated higher confidence in identifying relevant flows using TraceLens.</p></details> |  |

However, their continued advancement is constrained by the scarcity of high-quality, publicly available supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets tailored for coding tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce OpenCodeInstruct, the largest open-access instruction tuning dataset, comprising 5 million diverse samples. Each sample includes a programming question, solution, test cases, execution feedback, and LLM-generated quality assessments. We fine-tune various base models, including LLaMA and Qwen, across multiple scales (1B+, 3B+, and 7B+) using our dataset. Comprehensive evaluations on popular benchmarks (HumanEval, MBPP, LiveCodeBench, and BigCodeBench) demonstrate substantial performance improvements achieved by SFT with OpenCodeInstruct. We also present a detailed methodology encompassing seed data curation, synthetic instruction and solution generation, and filtering.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[From Code to Correctness: Closing the Last Mile of Code Generation with Hierarchical Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01215v3)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models have made significant strides in code generation, the pass rate of the generated code is bottlenecked on subtle errors, often requiring human intervention to pass tests, especially for complex problems. Existing LLM-based debugging systems treat generated programs as monolithic units, failing to address bugs at multiple levels of granularity, from low-level syntax errors to high-level algorithmic flaws. In this paper, we introduce Multi-Granularity Debugger (MGDebugger), a hierarchical code debugger by isolating, identifying, and resolving bugs at various levels of granularity. MGDebugger decomposes problematic code into a hierarchical tree structure of subfunctions, with each level representing a particular granularity of error. During debugging, it analyzes each subfunction and iteratively resolves bugs in a bottom-up manner. To effectively test each subfunction, we propose an LLM-simulated Python executor, which traces code execution and tracks important variable states to pinpoint errors accurately. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGDebugger outperforms existing debugging systems, achieving an 18.9% improvement in accuracy over seed generations in HumanEval and a 97.6% repair success rate in HumanEvalFix. Furthermore, MGDebugger effectively fixes bugs across different categories and difficulty levels, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data available at https://github.com/YerbaPage/MGDebugger</p></details> |

Given the ability of large language models (LLMs) to generate natural language and code, researchers are exploring their potential to generate log statements. However, prior work focuses on evaluating logs introduced in code functions, leaving file-level log generation underexplored -- especially in machine learning (ML) applications, where comprehensive logging can enhance reliability. In this study, we evaluate the capacity of GPT-4o mini as a case study to generate log statements for ML projects at file level. We gathered a set of 171 ML repositories containing 4,073 Python files with at least one log statement. We identified and removed the original logs from the files, prompted the LLM to generate logs for them, and evaluated both the position of the logs and log level, variables, and text quality of the generated logs compared to human-written logs. In addition, we manually analyzed a representative sample of generated logs to identify common patterns and challenges. We find that the LLM introduces logs in the same place as humans in 63.91% of cases, but at the cost of a high overlogging rate of 82.66%. Furthermore, our manual analysis reveals challenges for file-level logging, which shows overlogging at the beginning or end of a function, difficulty logging within large code blocks, and misalignment with project-specific logging conventions. While the LLM shows promise for generating logs for complete files, these limitations remain to be addressed for practical implementation.</p></details> |  |

This study benchmarks these four prominent LLMs on one hundred and fifty LeetCode problems across easy, medium, and hard difficulties, generating solutions in Java and Python. We evaluate each model based on execution time, memory usage, and algorithmic complexity, revealing significant performance differences. ChatGPT demonstrates consistent efficiency in execution time and memory usage, while Copilot and DeepSeek show variability as task complexity increases. Gemini, although effective on simpler tasks, requires more attempts as problem difficulty rises.

Does this expectation materialize in practice? How do we find out, making sure that proposed corrections actually work? If programmers have access to LLMs, how do they actually use them to complement their own skills? To answer these questions, we took advantage of the availability of a program-proving environment, which formally determines the correctness of proposed fixes, to conduct a study of program debugging with two randomly assigned groups of programmers, one with access to LLMs and the other without, both validating their answers through the proof tools. The methodology relied on a division into general research questions (Goals in the Goal-Query-Metric approach), specific elements admitting specific answers (Queries), and measurements supporting these answers (Metrics). While applied so far to a limited sample size, the results are a first step towards delineating a proper role for AI and LLMs in providing guaranteed-correct fixes to program bugs. These results caused surprise as compared to what one might expect from the use of AI for debugging and APR. The contributions also include: a detailed methodology for experiments in the use of LLMs for debugging, which other projects can reuse; a fine-grain analysis of programmer behavior, made possible by the use of full-session recording; a definition of patterns of use of LLMs, with 7 distinct categories; and validated advice for getting the best of LLMs for debugging and Automatic Program Repair.</p></details> |  |

Code generation not only facilitates faster prototyping and automated testing, but also augments developer efficiency through improved maintainability and reusability of code. In this paper, we introduce CodeIF, the first benchmark specifically designed to assess the abilities of LLMs to adhere to task-oriented instructions within diverse code generation scenarios. CodeIF encompasses a broad range of tasks, including function synthesis, error debugging, algorithmic refactoring, and code explanation, thereby providing a comprehensive suite to evaluate model performance across varying complexity levels and programming domains. We conduct extensive experiments with LLMs, analyzing their strengths and limitations in meeting the demands of these tasks. The experimental results offer valuable insights into how well current models align with human instructions, as well as the extent to which they can generate consistent, maintainable, and contextually relevant code.

An Empirical Study on the Testing Process of LLM-Powered Software Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00198v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Software systems powered by large language models are becoming a routine part of everyday technologies, supporting applications across a wide range of domains. In software engineering, many studies have focused on how LLMs support tasks such as code generation, debugging, and documentation. However, there has been limited focus on how full systems that integrate LLMs are tested during development. Aims: This study explores how LLM-powered systems are tested in the context of real-world application development. Method: We conducted an exploratory case study using 99 individual reports written by students who built and deployed LLM-powered applications as part of a university course. Each report was independently analyzed using thematic analysis, supported by a structured coding process. Results: Testing strategies combined manual and automated methods to evaluate both system logic and model behavior. Common practices included exploratory testing, unit testing, and prompt iteration. Reported challenges included integration failures, unpredictable outputs, prompt sensitivity, hallucinations, and uncertainty about correctness. Conclusions: Testing LLM-powered systems required adaptations to traditional verification methods, blending source-level reasoning with behavior-aware evaluations. These findings provide evidence on the practical context of testing generative components in software systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Screencast-Based Analysis of User-Perceived GUI Responsiveness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01337v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>GUI responsiveness is critical for a positive user experience in mobile applications. Even brief delays in visual feedback can frustrate users and lead to negative reviews. However, detecting and quantifying such user-perceived delays remains challenging, especially in industrial testing pipelines that evaluate thousands of apps daily across diverse devices and OS versions. Existing techniques based on static analysis or system metrics, while useful, may not accurately capture user-perceived issues or scale effectively. In this experience paper, we present \tool, a lightweight and black-box technique that measures GUI responsiveness directly from mobile screencasts -- video recordings captured during automated GUI testing. \tool detects user interactions and visual delays, helping developers identify GUI performance issues that affect the user experience. It uses computer vision to detect user interactions and analyzes frame-level visual changes to compute two key metrics: response time (from user action to first visual feedback) and finish time (until visual feedback stabilizes). We evaluate \tool on a manually annotated benchmark of 2,458 interactions from 64 popular Android apps. \tool achieves 0.96 precision and 0.93 recall in detecting interactions, and measures response and finish times within 50\,ms and 100\,ms error, respectively, for over 89\% of interactions. The tool has been deployed in an industrial testing pipeline and analyzes thousands of screencasts daily, uncovering responsiveness issues missed by traditional tools and improving performance debugging efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Distinct from previous code generation techniques, code generation agents are characterized by three core features. 1) Autonomy: the ability to independently manage the entire workflow, from task decomposition to coding and debugging. 2) Expanded task scope: capabilities that extend beyond generating code snippets to encompass the full software development lifecycle (SDLC). 3) Enhancement of engineering practicality: a shift in research emphasis from algorithmic innovation toward practical engineering challenges, such as system reliability, process management, and tool integration. This domain has recently witnessed rapid development and an explosion in research, demonstrating significant application potential. This paper presents a systematic survey of the field of LLM-based code generation agents. We trace the technology's developmental trajectory from its inception and systematically categorize its core techniques, including both single-agent and multi-agent architectures. Furthermore, this survey details the applications of LLM-based agents across the full SDLC, summarizes mainstream evaluation benchmarks and metrics, and catalogs representative tools. Finally, by analyzing the primary challenges, we identify and propose several foundational, long-term research directions for the future work of the field.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[Machine Learning Pipeline for Software Engineering: A Systematic Literature Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00045v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of software development practices has introduced challenges in ensuring quality and efficiency across the software engineering (SE) lifecycle. As SE systems grow in complexity, traditional approaches often fail to scale, resulting in longer debugging times, inefficient defect detection, and resource-heavy development cycles. Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a key solution, enabling automation in tasks such as defect prediction, code review, and release quality estimation. However, the effectiveness of ML in SE depends on the robustness of its pipeline, including data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, algorithm selection, validation, and evaluation. This systematic literature review (SLR) examines state-of-the-art ML pipelines designed for SE, consolidating best practices, challenges, and gaps. Our findings show that robust preprocessing, such as SMOTE for data balancing and SZZ-based algorithms for feature selection, improves model reliability. Ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting dominate performance across tasks, while simpler models such as Naive Bayes remain valuable for efficiency and interpretability. Evaluation metrics including AUC, F1-score, and precision are most common, with new metrics like Best Arithmetic Mean (BAM) emerging in niche applications. Validation techniques such as bootstrapping are widely used to ensure model stability and generalizability. This SLR highlights the importance of well-designed ML pipelines for addressing SE challenges and provides actionable insights for researchers and practitioners seeking to optimize software quality and efficiency. By identifying gaps and trends, this study sets a foundation for advancing ML adoption and fostering innovation in increasingly complex development environments.</p></details> |  |

We argue for eXplainable ABPs (XABPs) to address these concerns by enabling systems to articulate their rationale. The paper outlines a systematic approach to XABPs, characterizing their forms, structuring explainability, and identifying key BPM research challenges towards XABPs.</p></details> |  |

The ability to incorporate new IoT devices under the management of a centralized platform is an essential requirement. However, it requires significant human expertise and effort to program the complex IoT integration code that enables the platform to understand and control the device functions. Therefore, we propose AutoBridge to automate IoT integration code generation. Specifically, AutoBridge adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy: it first generates device control logic by progressively retrieving device-specific knowledge, then synthesizes platformcompliant integration code using platform-specific knowledge. To ensure correctness, AutoBridge features a multi-stage debugging pipeline, including an automated debugger for virtual IoT device testing and an interactive hardware-in-the-loop debugger that requires only binary user feedback (yes and no) for real-device verification. We evaluate AutoBridge on a benchmark of 34 IoT devices across two open-source IoT platforms. The results demonstrate that AutoBridge can achieves an average success rate of 93.87% and an average function coverage of 94.87%, without any human involvement. With minimal binary yes and no feedback from users, the code is then revised to reach 100% function coverage. A user study with 15 participants further shows that AutoBridge outperforms expert programmers by 50% to 80% in code accuracy, even when the programmers are allowed to use commercial code LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 12 figures, under review</p></details> |

Debugging remains unsolved despite these advances. While Claude Opus 4 and GPT-4.1 achieve >70% on code synthesis benchmarks, they perform <15% on real debugging tasks. We introduce Kodezi Chronos, a language model built specifically for debugging. Chronos combines Adaptive Graph-Guided Retrieval to navigate codebases up to 10 million lines using multi-hop traversal (92% precision, 85% recall), Persistent Debug Memory trained on 15M+ sessions, and a 7-layer architecture for iterative fix-test-refine loops. On 5,000 real-world scenarios, Chronos achieves 67.3% fix accuracy, compared to 14.2% and 13.8% for Claude and GPT-4.1 respectively. Chronos reduces debugging time by 40% and iteration count by 65%. It resolves complex multi-file bugs involving cross-repository context and temporal reasoning. Key limitations include 23.4% success on hardware-dependent issues and 41.2% on dynamic language errors. Theoretical analysis shows O(k log d) retrieval complexity with convergence guarantees. In a human evaluation (N=50), 89% of participants preferred Chronos over baseline models. Chronos will be available in Kodezi OS in Q4 2025 and via API in Q1 2026.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 21 figures, 37 tables, 2 algorithms.

However, debugging HLS code is a challenging and labor-intensive task, especially for novice circuit designers or software engineers without sufficient hardware domain knowledge. The recent emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) is promising in automating the HLS debugging process. Despite the great potential, three key challenges persist when applying LLMs to HLS logic debugging: 1) High-quality circuit data for training LLMs is scarce, posing a significant challenge. 2) Debugging logic bugs in hardware is inherently more complex than identifying software bugs with existing golden test cases. 3) The absence of reliable test cases requires multi-tasking solutions, performing both bug identification and correction. complicates the multi-tasking required for effective HLS debugging. In this work, we propose a customized solution named HLSDebugger to address the challenges. HLSDebugger first generates and releases a large labeled dataset with 300K data samples, targeting HLS logic bugs. The HLSDebugger model adopts an encoder-decoder structure, performing bug location identification, bug type prediction, and bug correction with the same model. HLSDebugger significantly outperforms advanced LLMs like GPT-4 in bug identification and by more than 3x in bug correction. It makes a substantial advancement in the exploration of automated debugging of HLS code.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted at ICCAD 2025 (International Conference on Computer-Aided Design)</p></details> |

Traditional debugging techniques from classical software engineering cannot directly resolve this issue due to the inherently stochastic nature of quantum computation mixed with noises from NISQ computers. To address this gap, we propose a statistical approach leveraging probabilistic metrics to differentiate between quantum software bugs and hardware noise. We evaluate our methodology empirically using well-known quantum algorithms, including Grover's algorithm, Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, and Simon's algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy and practical applicability of our approach, providing quantum software developers with a reliable analytical tool to identify and classify unexpected behavior in quantum programs.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 30 figures, accepted by the IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering (QCE), IEEE Quantum Week, 2025</p></details> |
| **[BOOP: Write Right Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22085v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Novice programmers frequently adopt a syntax-specific and test-case-driven approach, writing code first and adjusting until programs compile and test cases pass, rather than developing correct solutions through systematic reasoning. AI coding tools exacerbate this challenge by providing syntactically correct but conceptually flawed solutions. In this paper, we introduce BOOP (Blueprint, Operations, OCaml, Proof), a structured framework requiring four mandatory phases: formal specification, language-agnostic algorithm development, implementation, and correctness proof. This shifts focus from ``making code work'' to understanding why code is correct. BOOP was implemented at our institution using a VS Code extension and preprocessor that enforces constraints and identifies counterproductive patterns. Initial evaluation shows improved algorithmic reasoning and reduced trial-and-error debugging. Students reported better edge case understanding and problem decomposition, though some initially found the format verbose. Instructors observed stronger foundational skills compared to traditional approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgentMesh: A Cooperative Multi-Agent Generative AI Framework for Software Development Automation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19902v1)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software development is a complex, multi-phase process traditionally requiring collaboration among individuals with diverse expertise. We propose AgentMesh, a Python-based framework that uses multiple cooperating LLM-powered agents to automate software development tasks. In AgentMesh, specialized agents - a Planner, Coder, Debugger, and Reviewer - work in concert to transform a high-level requirement into fully realized code. The Planner agent first decomposes user requests into concrete subtasks; the Coder agent implements each subtask in code; the Debugger agent tests and fixes the code; and the Reviewer agent validates the final output for correctness and quality. We describe the architecture and design of these agents and their communication, and provide implementation details including prompt strategies and workflow orchestration. A case study illustrates AgentMesh handling a non-trivial development request via sequential task planning, code generation, iterative debugging, and final code review. We discuss how dividing responsibilities among cooperative agents leverages the strengths of large language models while mitigating single-agent limitations. Finally, we examine current limitations - such as error propagation and context scaling - and outline future work toward more robust, scalable multi-agent AI systems for software engineering automation.</p></details> |  |
| **[SLICEMATE: Accurate and Scalable Static Program Slicing via LLM-Powered Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18957v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Static program slicing, which extracts the executable portions of a program that affect the values at a specific location, supports many software analysis tasks such as debugging and security auditing. However, traditional slicing tools rely on computationally expensive reachability analysis over dependency graphs, which struggle to scale to large programs and often fail to handle code with incomplete syntax. Recently emerged learning-based methods, while more robust to such cases, still fall short of achieving comparable performance to traditional methods on well-formed code. In this work, we propose SliceMate, a novel static program slicing solution powered by Large Language Model (LLM) agents. It bypasses the need for explicit dependency graph construction and achieving superior slicing accuracy. Concretely, SliceMate integrates three specialized agents: (1) a synthesis agent that produces candidate slices by incrementally expanding the scan scope across functions and files guided by LLM-inferred dependencies; (2) a verification agent that performs conciseness and completeness checks of the candidate slices, detecting missing or irrelevant statements; and (3) a refinement agent that repairs the slices with minimal edits in accordance with the verification results. These agents are orchestrated by a control module that ensures timely convergence and outputs high-quality slices without manual intervention. For rigorous evaluation, we construct a new and high-quality benchmark, SliceBench, comprising 2,200 manually annotated Java and Python programs, with program lengths ranging from 5 to 8,577 lines, significantly larger than those in existing slicing benchmarks. Experimental results show that SliceMate greatly outperforms both traditional and learning-based slicing tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[MemoCoder: Automated Function Synthesis using LLM-Supported Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18812v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT, developers increasingly rely on AI-assisted tools to support code generation. While LLMs can generate syntactically correct solutions for well-structured programming tasks, they often struggle with challenges that require iterative debugging, error handling, or adaptation to diverse problem structures. Existing approaches such as fine-tuning or self-repair strategies either require costly retraining or lack mechanisms to accumulate and reuse knowledge from previous attempts. To address these limitations, we propose MemoCoder, a multi-agent framework that enables collaborative problem solving and persistent learning from past fixes. At the core of MemoCoder is a Fixing Knowledge Set, which stores successful repairs and supports retrieval for future tasks. A central Mentor Agent supervises the repair process by identifying recurring error patterns and refining high-level fixing strategies, providing a novel supervisory role that guides the self-repair loop. We evaluate MemoCoder across three public benchmarks -- MBPP, HumanEval, and LiveCodeBench -- spanning a range of problem complexities. Experimental results show that MemoCoder consistently outperforms both zero-shot prompting and a Self-Repair strategy, with improvements ranging from 3.1% to 12.1% in Pass@10 and from 1.4% to 14.5% in Pass@50, demonstrating its effectiveness in iterative refinement and knowledge-guided code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeReasoner: Enhancing the Code Reasoning Ability with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17548v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code reasoning is a fundamental capability for large language models (LLMs) in the code domain. It involves understanding and predicting a program's execution behavior, such as determining the output for a given input or whether a specific statement will be executed. This capability is essential for downstream tasks like debugging, code generation, and program repair. Prior approaches mainly rely on supervised fine-tuning to improve performance in code reasoning tasks. However, they often show limited gains and fail to generalize across diverse scenarios. We argue this is due to two core issues: the low quality of training data and the limitations of supervised fine-tuning, which struggles to teach general reasoning skills. To address these challenges, we propose CodeReasoner, a framework that spans both dataset construction and a two-stage training process. First, we introduce a method to construct datasets that focus on the core execution logic of Python programs. Next, we apply instruction tuning to inject execution-specific knowledge distilled from a powerful teacher model. We then enhance reasoning and generalization through GRPO reinforcement learning on top of the fine-tuned model. Experiments on three widely-used code reasoning benchmarks show that CodeReasoner improves performance by 27.1% to 40.2% over prior methods using a 7B model. Notably, the 7B model matches GPT-4o on key tasks like input/output and coverage prediction. When scaled to 14B, CodeReasoner outperforms GPT-4o across all benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each training stage and highlight the importance of reasoning chains.</p></details> |  |
| **[AssertFlip: Reproducing Bugs via Inversion of LLM-Generated Passing Tests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17542v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bug reproduction is critical in the software debugging and repair process, yet the majority of bugs in open-source and industrial settings lack executable tests to reproduce them at the time they are reported, making diagnosis and resolution more difficult and time-consuming. To address this challenge, we introduce AssertFlip, a novel technique for automatically generating Bug Reproducible Tests (BRTs) using large language models (LLMs). Unlike existing methods that attempt direct generation of failing tests, AssertFlip first generates passing tests on the buggy behaviour and then inverts these tests to fail when the bug is present. We hypothesize that LLMs are better at writing passing tests than ones that crash or fail on purpose. Our results show that AssertFlip outperforms all known techniques in the leaderboard of SWT-Bench, a benchmark curated for BRTs. Specifically, AssertFlip achieves a fail-to-pass success rate of 43.6% on the SWT-Bench-Verified subset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Understanding the Challenges of Bug Localization in Deep Learning Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01021v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software bugs cost the global economy billions of dollars annually and claim ~50\% of the programming time from software developers. Locating these bugs is crucial for their resolution but challenging. It is even more challenging in deep-learning systems due to their black-box nature. Bugs in these systems are also hidden not only in the code but also in the models and training data, which might make traditional debugging methods less effective. In this article, we conduct a large-scale empirical study to better understand the challenges of localizing bugs in deep-learning systems. First, we determine the bug localization performance of four existing techniques using 2,365 bugs from deep-learning systems and 2,913 from traditional software. We found these techniques significantly underperform in localizing deep-learning system bugs. Second, we evaluate how different bug types in deep learning systems impact bug localization. We found that the effectiveness of localization techniques varies with bug type due to their unique challenges. For example, tensor bugs were more accessible to locate due to their structural nature, while all techniques struggled with GPU bugs due to their external dependencies. Third, we investigate the impact of bugs' extrinsic nature on localization in deep-learning systems. We found that deep learning bugs are often extrinsic and thus connected to artifacts other than source code (e.g., GPU, training data), contributing to the poor performance of existing localization methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Empirical Software Engineering Journal in 2025</p></details> |

A Study on Competition-Level Programming Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06821v3)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, capable of tackling complex tasks during inference. However, the extent to which LLMs can be utilized for code checking or debugging through test case generation remains largely unexplored. We investigate this problem from the perspective of competition-level programming (CP) programs and propose TCGBench, a Benchmark for (LLM generation of) Test Case Generators. This benchmark comprises two tasks, aimed at studying the capabilities of LLMs in (1) generating valid test case generators for a given CP problem, and further (2) generating targeted test case generators that expose bugs in human-written code. Experimental results indicate that while state-of-the-art LLMs can generate valid test case generators in most cases, most LLMs struggle to generate targeted test cases that reveal flaws in human code effectively. Especially, even advanced reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) fall significantly short of human performance in the task of generating targeted generators. Furthermore, we construct a high-quality, manually curated dataset of instructions for generating targeted generators. Analysis demonstrates that the performance of LLMs can be enhanced with the aid of this dataset, by both prompting and fine-tuning.</p></details> | 37 pages, 22 figures |
| **[On the Need for a Statistical Foundation in Scenario-Based Testing of Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02274v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scenario-based testing has emerged as a common method for autonomous vehicles (AVs) safety assessment, offering a more efficient alternative to mile-based testing by focusing on high-risk scenarios. However, fundamental questions persist regarding its stopping rules, residual risk estimation, debug effectiveness, and the impact of simulation fidelity on safety claims. This paper argues that a rigorous statistical foundation is essential to address these challenges and enable rigorous safety assurance. By drawing parallels between AV testing and established software testing methods, we identify shared research gaps and reusable solutions. We propose proof-of-concept models to quantify the probability of failure per scenario (\textit{pfs}) and evaluate testing effectiveness under varying conditions. Our analysis reveals that neither scenario-based nor mile-based testing universally outperforms the other. Furthermore, we give an example of formal reasoning about alignment of synthetic and real-world testing outcomes, a first step towards supporting statistically defensible simulation-based safety claims.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ITSC 2025</p></details> |

DL frameworks have traditionally embraced deferred execution-style DL code -- supporting symbolic, graph-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) computation. While scalable, such development is error-prone, non-intuitive, and difficult to debug. Consequently, more natural, imperative DL frameworks encouraging eager execution have emerged but at the expense of run-time performance. Though hybrid approaches aim for the "best of both worlds," using them effectively requires subtle considerations. Our key insight is that, while DL programs typically execute sequentially, hybridizing imperative DL code resembles parallelizing sequential code in traditional systems. Inspired by this, we present an automated refactoring approach that assists developers in determining which otherwise eagerly-executed imperative DL functions could be effectively and efficiently executed as graphs. The approach features novel static imperative tensor and side-effect analyses for Python. Due to its inherent dynamism, analyzing Python may be unsound; however, the conservative approach leverages a speculative (keyword-based) analysis for resolving difficult cases that informs developers of any assumptions made. The approach is: (i) implemented as a plug-in to the PyDev Eclipse IDE that integrates the WALA Ariadne analysis framework and (ii) evaluated on nineteen DL projects consisting of 132 KLOC. The results show that 326 of 766 candidate functions (42.56%) were refactorable, and an average relative speedup of 2.16 on performance tests was observed with negligible differences in model accuracy. The results indicate that the approach is useful in optimizing imperative DL code to its full potential.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Code Comprehension Benchmark for Large Language Models for Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10641v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models have shown impressive capabilities in coding tasks like code generation and code completion, as they have been trained on a large amount of code data. Also, since one of the core pretraining objectives is Next Token Prediction, these models tends to learn surface-level syntactic patterns in code. However, this does not guarantee code comprehension ability i.e. the ability to capture the semantics of the code. In our opinion, this is the reason why these models often underperform on tasks that require deeper semantic understanding, such as code debugging and code optimization. To address this, we propose fine-tuning these models specifically for code comprehension tasks using large-scale datasets, enabling them to develop a more robust understanding of code semantics. We evaluate three code models of varying sizes on a suite of code comprehension tasks designed to assess semantic understanding beyond surface-level syntactic pattern matching. In particular, we analyze performance on the Subjectivity Grading Task and observe that model performance improves after fine-tuning on relevant downstream tasks. The most significant improvement is seen in the QWQ-32B model, where accuracy increases from 70% to 83.47%. A similar or explainable trend is observed across other models, clearly indicating an enhancement in code comprehension ability. Among the models studied, the DPO-fine-tuned Codestral-22B achieves the highest micro-accuracy of 87.66% on the Subjectivity Grading Task.</p></details> | 10 Pages, 5 Figures |

We introduce the Debugging Decay Index (DDI), a mathematical framework that quantifies when debugging becomes ineffective and predicts intervention points. Our strategic fresh start approach shifts from exploitation to exploration at strategic points in the debugging process, demonstrating that well-timed interventions can rescue the effectiveness of debugging. DDI reveals a fundamental limitation in current AI debugging and provides the first quantitative framework for optimising iterative code generation strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tool for Supporting Debugging and Understanding of Normative Requirements Using LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05504v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Normative requirements specify social, legal, ethical, empathetic, and cultural (SLEEC) norms that must be observed by a system. To support the identification of SLEEC requirements, numerous standards and regulations have been developed. These requirements are typically defined by stakeholders in the non-technical system with diverse expertise (e.g., ethicists, lawyers, social scientists). Hence, ensuring their consistency and managing the requirement elicitation process are complex and error-prone tasks. Recent research has addressed this challenge using domain-specific languages to specify normative requirements as rules, whose consistency can then be analyzed with formal methods. Nevertheless, these approaches often present the results from formal verification tools in a way that is inaccessible to non-technical users. This hinders understanding and makes the iterative process of eliciting and validating these requirements inefficient in terms of both time and effort. To address this problem, we introduce SLEEC-LLM, a tool that uses large language models (LLMs) to provide natural-language interpretations for model-checking counterexamples corresponding to SLEEC rule inconsistencies. SLEEC-LLM improves the efficiency and explainability of normative requirements elicitation and consistency analysis. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we summarise its use in two real-world case studies involving non-technical stakeholders.</p></details> |  |

This is especially the case as we acknowledge the prospects of negative impacts from these technologies. Traditional software engineering methods, such as testing and debugging, have proven effective in maintaining software quality; however, they reveal significant research and practice gaps in maintaining neural networks. In particular, there is a limited understanding of how practitioners currently address challenges related to understanding and mitigating undesirable behaviors in neural networks. In our ongoing research, we explore the current state of research and practice in maintaining neural networks by curating insights from practitioners through a preliminary study involving interviews and supporting survey responses. Our findings thus far indicate that existing tools primarily concentrate on building and training models. While these tools can be beneficial, they often fall short of supporting practitioners' understanding and addressing the underlying causes of unexpected model behavior. By evaluating current procedures and identifying the limitations of traditional methodologies, our study aims to offer a developer-centric perspective on where current practices fall short and highlight opportunities for improving maintenance support in neural networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised version accepted at the HumanAISE Workshop, co-located with FSE 2025</p></details> |

However, debugging and repairing the underlying faults can be complex and time-consuming when verification fails. Automated Program Repair (APR) aims to ease this by automatically identifying and fixing faults. Traditional APR techniques often depend on test suites for validation, but these may fail to capture all scenarios. In contrast, formal specifications provide stronger correctness criteria for effective repairs. We present an innovative APR tool for Dafny, a verification-aware programming language that uses formal specifications - including pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants - as oracles for fault localization and repair. Assuming the correctness of the specifications and focusing on arithmetic bugs, we localize faults through a series of steps, which include using Hoare Logic to determine the state of each statement within the program and state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize candidate fixes. The chosen models were GPT-4o mini, Llama 3, Mistral 7B, and Llemma 7B. We evaluate our approach using DafnyBench, a benchmark of real-world Dafny programs. Our tool achieves 89.6% accuracy in fault localization, with GPT-4o mini yielding the highest repair success rate (74.18%). These results highlight the potential of combining formal reasoning with LLM-driven program synthesis for automated program repair.</p></details> |  |

Developers are increasingly adopting these tools across tasks, including coding, testing, debugging, documentation, and design. Yet, despite growing interest, there is no synthesis of how LLM-assistants affect software developer productivity. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review of 37 peer-reviewed studies published between January 2014 and December 2024 that examine this impact. Our analysis reveals that LLM-assistants offer both considerable benefits and critical risks. Commonly reported gains include minimized code search, accelerated development, and the automation of trivial and repetitive tasks. However, studies also highlight concerns around cognitive offloading, reduced team collaboration, and inconsistent effects on code quality. While the majority of studies (92%) adopt a multi-dimensional perspective by examining at least two SPACE dimensions, reflecting increased awareness of the complexity of developer productivity, only 14% extend beyond three dimensions, indicating substantial room for more integrated evaluations. Satisfaction, Performance, and Efficiency are the most frequently investigated dimensions, whereas Communication and Activity remain underexplored. Most studies are exploratory (64%) and methodologically diverse, but lack longitudinal and team-based evaluations. This review surfaces key research gaps and provides recommendations for future research and practice.

Despite its widespread use in Open Source Software projects, there is limited understanding of how and why developers use mocks and the challenges they face. In this collaborative study, we have analyzed 25,302 questions related to Mocking on STACKOVERFLOW to identify the challenges faced by developers. We have used Latent Dirichlet Allocation for topic modeling, identified 30 key topics, and grouped the topics into five key categories. Consequently, we analyzed the annual and relative probabilities of each category to understand the evolution of mocking-related discussions. Trend analysis reveals that category like Advanced Programming peaked between 2009 and 2012 but have since declined, while categories such as Mocking Techniques and External Services have remained consistently dominant, highlighting evolving developer priorities and ongoing technical challenges. Our findings also show an inverse relationship between a topic's popularity and its difficulty. Popular topics like Framework Selection tend to have lower difficulty and faster resolution times, while complex topics like HTTP Requests and Responses are more likely to remain unanswered and take longer to resolve. A classification of questions into How, Why, What, and Other revealed that over 70% are How questions, particularly in practical domains like file access and APIs, indicating a strong need for implementation guidance. Why questions are more prevalent in error-handling contexts, reflecting conceptual challenges in debugging, while What questions are rare and mostly tied to theoretical discussions. These insights offer valuable guidance for improving developer support, tooling, and educational content in the context of mocking and unit testing.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Feasibility of Deduplicating Compiler Bugs with Bisection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23281v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Random testing has proven to be an effective technique for compiler validation. However, the debugging of bugs identified through random testing presents a significant challenge due to the frequent occurrence of duplicate test programs that expose identical compiler bugs. The process to identify duplicates is a practical research problem known as bug deduplication. Prior methodologies for compiler bug deduplication primarily rely on program analysis to extract bug-related features for duplicate identification, which can result in substantial computational overhead and limited generalizability. This paper investigates the feasibility of employing bisection, a standard debugging procedure largely overlooked in prior research on compiler bug deduplication, for this purpose. Our study demonstrates that the utilization of bisection to locate failure-inducing commits provides a valuable criterion for deduplication, albeit one that requires supplementary techniques for more accurate identification. Building on these results, we introduce BugLens, a novel deduplication method that primarily uses bisection, enhanced by the identification of bug-triggering optimizations to minimize false negatives. Empirical evaluations conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate that BugLens significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art analysis-based methodologies Tamer and D3 by saving an average of 26.98% and 9.64% human effort to identify the same number of distinct bugs. Given the inherent simplicity and generalizability of bisection, it presents a highly practical solution for compiler bug deduplication in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

| **[Dually Hierarchical Drift Adaptation for Online Configuration Performance Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08730v4)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern configurable software systems need to learn models that correlate configuration and performance. However, when the system operates in dynamic environments, the workload variations, hardware changes, and system updates will inevitably introduce concept drifts at different levels - global drifts, which reshape the performance landscape of the entire configuration space; and local drifts, which only affect certain sub-regions of that space. As such, existing offline and transfer learning approaches can struggle to adapt to these implicit and unpredictable changes in real-time, rendering configuration performance learning challenging. To address this, we propose DHDA, an online configuration performance learning framework designed to capture and adapt to these drifts at different levels. The key idea is that DHDA adapts to both the local and global drifts using dually hierarchical adaptation: at the upper level, we redivide the data into different divisions, within each of which the local model is retrained, to handle global drifts only when necessary. At the lower level, the local models of the divisions can detect local drifts and adapt themselves asynchronously. To balance responsiveness and efficiency, DHDA combines incremental updates with periodic full retraining to minimize redundant computation when no drifts are detected. Through evaluating eight software systems and against state-of-the-art approaches, we show that DHDA achieves considerably better accuracy and can effectively adapt to drifts with up to 2x improvements, while incurring reasonable overhead and is able to improve different local models in handling concept drift.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICSE 2026</p></details> |

Existing approaches -- ownership systems, linear and affine types, uniqueness types, and lexical effect tracking -- impose global restrictions such as uniqueness or linearity, or rely on shallow syntactic analyses. These designs fall short with higher-order functions and shared mutable state. Reachability Types (RT) track aliasing and separation in higher-order programs, ensuring runtime safety and non-interference. However, RT systems face three key limitations: (1) they prohibit cyclic references, ruling out non-terminating computations and fixed-point combinators; (2) they require deep tracking, where a qualifier must include all transitively reachable locations, reducing precision and hindering optimizations like fine-grained parallelism; and (3) referent qualifier invariance prevents referents from escaping their allocation contexts, making reference factories inexpressible. In this work, we address these limitations by extending RT with three mechanisms that enhance expressiveness. First, we introduce cyclic references, enabling recursive patterns to be encoded directly through the store. Second, we adopt shallow qualifier tracking, decoupling references from their transitively reachable values. Finally, we introduce an escaping rule with reference subtyping, allowing referent qualifiers to outlive their allocation context. These extensions are formalized in the $\mathsf{F}_{<:}^{\circ}$-calculus with a mechanized proof of type soundness, and case studies illustrate expressiveness through fixpoint combinators, non-interfering parallelism, and escaping read-only references.</p></details> |  |

| **[Locus: Agentic Predicate Synthesis for Directed Fuzzing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21302v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Directed fuzzing aims to find program inputs that lead to specified target program states. It has broad applications, such as debugging system crashes, confirming reported bugs, and generating exploits for potential vulnerabilities. This task is inherently challenging because target states are often deeply nested in the program, while the search space manifested by numerous possible program inputs is prohibitively large. Existing approaches rely on branch distances or manually-specified constraints to guide the search; however, the branches alone are often insufficient to precisely characterize progress toward reaching the target states, while the manually specified constraints are often tailored for specific bug types and thus difficult to generalize to diverse target states and programs. We present Locus, a novel framework to improve the efficiency of directed fuzzing. Our key insight is to synthesize predicates to capture fuzzing progress as semantically meaningful intermediate states, serving as milestones towards reaching the target states. When used to instrument the program under fuzzing, they can reject executions unlikely to reach the target states, while providing additional coverage guidance. To automate this task and generalize to diverse programs, Locus features an agentic framework with program analysis tools to synthesize and iteratively refine the candidate predicates, while ensuring the predicates strictly relax the target states to prevent false rejections via symbolic execution. Our evaluation shows that Locus substantially improves the efficiency of eight state-of-the-art fuzzers in discovering real-world vulnerabilities, achieving an average speedup of 41.6x. So far, Locus has found eight previously unpatched bugs, with one already acknowledged with a draft patch.</p></details> |  |
| **[ConfLogger: Enhance Systems' Configuration Diagnosability through Configuration Logging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20977v2)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern configurable systems offer customization via intricate configuration spaces, yet such flexibility introduces pervasive configuration-related issues such as misconfigurations and latent softwarebugs. Existing diagnosability supports focus on post-failure analysis of software behavior to identify configuration issues, but none of these approaches look into whether the software clue sufficient failure information for diagnosis. To fill in the blank, we propose the idea of configuration logging to enhance existing logging practices at the source code level. We develop ConfLogger, the first tool that unifies configuration-aware static taint analysis with LLM-based log generation to enhance software configuration diagnosability. Specifically, our method 1) identifies configuration-sensitive code segments by tracing configuration-related data flow in the whole project, and 2) generates diagnostic log statements by analyzing configuration code contexts. Evaluation results on eight popular software systems demonstrate the effectiveness of ConfLogger to enhance configuration diagnosability. Specifically, ConfLogger-enhanced logs successfully aid a log-based misconfiguration diagnosis tool to achieve 100% accuracy on error localization in 30 silent misconfiguration scenarios, with 80% directly resolvable through explicit configuration information exposed. In addition, ConfLogger achieves 74% coverage of existing logging points, outperforming baseline LLM-based loggers by 12% and 30%. It also gains 8.6% higher in precision, 79.3% higher in recall, and 26.2% higher in F1 compared to the state-of-the-art baseline in terms of variable logging while also augmenting diagnostic value. A controlled user study on 22 cases further validated its utility, speeding up diagnostic time by 1.25x and improving troubleshooting accuracy by 251.4%.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, accepted by ICSE '26 (The 48th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering)</p></details> |
| **[LLM as an Execution Estimator: Recovering Missing Dependency for Practical Time-travelling Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18721v4)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose RecovSlicing for computing dynamic data dependency in a single run, with only partial instrumentation. We explore the intuition that LLM can potentially infer program dynamics based on a partially recorded trace and relevant code as its context. Given (1) a partially recorded trace of a program $P$ and (2) the slicing criteria consisting of a query step $s$ and a query variable $v$ read by $s$, RecovSlicing computes the runtime definition of $v$ on the trace by estimating the miss-recorded execution of $P$. In this work, we allow the user to specify implicit query variable, for example, the implicit library variable used in list{\ttfamily .}get(i). Technically, built upon non-deterministic LLM, we address the challenges of (1) precise recovery of runtime variable value and structure from the recorded execution and (2) aligning the memory address of recovered variables and the recorded variables for definition analysis. We extensively evaluate RecovSlicing against the state-of-the-art slicers such as Slicer4J, ND-Slicer, LLM Slicer, and re-execution Slicer on a total number of 8300 data-dependencies over 3 slicing benchmarks. The results show that RecovSlicing can significantly outperform the baselines. The accuracy and recall, achieving 80.3%, 91.1%, and 98.3% on the three benchmarks, whereas the best baseline reaches 39.0%, 82.0%, and 59.9% (accuracy), and 53.4%, 79.1%, and 87.1% (recall), respectively. In addition, we integrate RecovSlicing in a dual-slicing based regression bug localizer, significantly improving its performance by locating 16% more regressions.</p></details> |  |

We present a lightweight framework that instruction-tuned large language model (LLM) with LoRA adapters and uses candidate-constrained decoding to ensure valid assignments. Tested on EclipseJDT and Mozilla datasets, the model achieves strong shortlist quality (Hit at 10 up to 0.753) despite modest exact Top-1 accuracy. On recent snapshots, accuracy rises sharply, showing the framework's potential for real-world, human-in-the-loop triaging. Our results suggest that instruction-tuned LLMs offer a practical alternative to costly feature engineering and graph-based methods.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Deep Learning Based Concurrency Bug Detection and Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20911v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concurrency bugs, caused by improper synchronization of shared resources in multi-threaded or distributed systems, are notoriously hard to detect and thus compromise software reliability and security. The existing deep learning methods face three main limitations. First, there is an absence of large and dedicated datasets of diverse concurrency bugs for them. Second, they lack sufficient representation of concurrency semantics. Third, binary classification results fail to provide finer-grained debug information such as precise bug lines. To address these problems, we propose a novel method for effective concurrency bug detection as well as localization. We construct a dedicated concurrency bug dataset to facilitate model training and evaluation. We then integrate a pre-trained model with a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN), by incorporating a new Concurrency-Aware Code Property Graph (CCPG) that concisely and effectively characterizes concurrency semantics. To further facilitate debugging, we employ SubgraphX, a GNN-based interpretability method, which explores the graphs to precisely localize concurrency bugs, mapping them to specific lines of source code. On average, our method demonstrates an improvement of 10\% in accuracy and precision and 26\% in recall compared to state-of-the-art methods across diverse evaluation settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Test Oracles for Flaky Cyber-Physical System Simulators: Approach and Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20902v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulation-based testing of cyber-physical systems (CPS) is costly due to the time-consuming execution of CPS simulators. In addition, CPS simulators may be flaky, leading to inconsistent test outcomes and requiring repeated test re-execution for reliable test verdicts. Automated test oracles that do not require system execution are therefore crucial for reducing testing costs. Ideally, such test oracles should be interpretable to facilitate human understanding of test verdicts, and they must be robust against the potential flakiness of CPS simulators. In this article, we propose assertion-based test oracles for CPS as sets of logical and arithmetic predicates defined over the inputs of the system under test. Given a test input, our assertion-based test oracle determines, without requiring test execution, whether the test passes, fails, or if the oracle is inconclusive in predicting a verdict. We describe two methods for generating assertion-based test oracles: one using genetic programming~(GP) that employs well-known spectrum-based fault localization (SBFL) ranking formulas, namely Ochiai, Tarantula, and Naish, as fitness functions; and the other using decision trees (DT) and decision rules (DR). We evaluate our assertion-based test oracles through case studies in the domains of aerospace, networking and autonomous driving. We show that test oracles generated using GP with Ochiai are significantly more accurate than those obtained using GP with Tarantula and Naish or using DT or DR. Moreover, this accuracy advantage remains even when accounting for the flakiness of the system under test. We further show that the assertion-based test oracles generated by GP with Ochiai are robust against flakiness with only 4% average variation in their accuracy results across four different network and autonomous driving systems with flaky behaviours.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Joint Learning Framework for Bridging Defect Prediction and Interpretation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16429v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past fifty years, numerous software defect prediction (SDP) approaches have been proposed. However, the ability to explain why predictors make certain predictions remains limited. Explainable SDP has emerged as a promising solution by using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods to clarify the decision-making processes of predictors. Despite this progress, there is still significant potential to enhance the reliability of existing approaches. To address this limitation, we treat defect prediction and the corresponding interpretation as two distinct but closely related tasks and propose a joint learning framework that allows for the simultaneous training of the predictor and its interpreter. The novelty of our approach lies in two main aspects: 1. We design feedback loops that convey the decision-making logic from the predictor to the interpreter. This ensures a high level of conciseness in decision logic and feature engineering for both the predictor and the interpreter, enabling the interpreter to achieve reliable local and global interpretability. 2. We incorporate the interpretation results as a penalty term in the loss function of the joint-learning framework. This not only improves the accuracy of the predictor but also imposes a stronger constraint on the reliability of the interpreter. We validated our proposed method against several existing explainable SDPs across multiple datasets. The results demonstrate its effectiveness in both interpretation and defect prediction. The source code for the proposed method is available at: https://github.com/BugPredictor/software-defect-prediction.git</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Root Cause Localization for Microservice Systems with Multi-Agent Recursion-of-Thought](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20370v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As contemporary microservice systems become increasingly popular and complex-often comprising hundreds or even thousands of fine-grained, interdependent subsystems-they are facing more frequent failures. Ensuring system reliability thus demands accurate root cause localization. While traces and metrics have proven to be effective data sources for this task, existing methods either heavily rely on pre-defined schemas, which struggle to adapt to evolving operational contexts, or lack interpretability in their reasoning process, thereby leaving Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) confused. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on how SREs localize the root cause of failures, drawing insights from multiple professional SREs across different organizations. Our investigation reveals that human root cause analysis exhibits three key characteristics: recursiveness, multi-dimensional expansion, and cross-modal reasoning. Motivated by these findings, we introduce RCLAgent, an adaptive root cause localization method for microservice systems that leverages a multi-agent recursion-of-thought framework. RCLAgent employs a novel recursion-of-thought strategy to guide the LLM's reasoning process, effectively integrating data from multiple agents and tool-assisted analysis to accurately pinpoint the root cause. Experimental evaluations on various public datasets demonstrate that RCLAgent achieves superior performance by localizing the root cause using only a single request-outperforming state-of-the-art methods that depend on aggregating multiple requests. These results underscore the effectiveness of RCLAgent in enhancing the efficiency and precision of root cause localization in complex microservice environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting Skeleton-Driven SMT Solver Fuzzing by Leveraging LLM to Produce Formula Generators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20340v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers are foundational to modern systems and programming languages research, providing the foundation for tasks like symbolic execution and automated verification. Because these solvers sit on the critical path, their correctness is essential, and high-quality test formulas are key to uncovering bugs. However, while prior testing techniques performed well on earlier solver versions, they struggle to keep pace with rapidly evolving features. Recent approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in exploring advanced solver capabilities, but two obstacles remain: nearly half of the generated formulas are syntactically invalid, and iterative interactions with the LLMs introduce substantial computational overhead. In this study, we present Chimera, a novel LLM-assisted fuzzing framework that addresses both issues by shifting from direct formula generation to the synthesis of reusable term (i.e., logical expression) generators. Particularly, Chimera uses LLMs to (1) automatically extract context-free grammars (CFGs) for SMT theories, including solver-specific extensions, from documentation, and (2) synthesize composable Boolean term generators that adhere to these grammars. During fuzzing, Chimera populates structural skeletons derived from existing formulas with the terms iteratively produced by the LLM-synthesized generators. This design ensures syntactic validity while promoting semantic diversity. Notably, Chimera requires only one-time LLM interaction investment, dramatically reducing runtime cost. We evaluated Chimera on two leading SMT solvers: Z3 and cvc5. Our experiments show that Chimera has identified 43 confirmed bugs, 40 of which have already been fixed by developers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting Metadata-Related Bugs in Enterprise Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14463v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When building enterprise applications (EAs) on Java frameworks (e.g., Spring), developers often configure application components via metadata (i.e., Java annotations and XML files). It is challenging for developers to correctly use metadata, because the usage rules can be complex and existing tools provide limited assistance. When developers misuse metadata, EAs become misconfigured, which defects can trigger erroneous runtime behaviors or introduce security vulnerabilities. To help developers correctly use metadata, this paper presents (1) RSL -- a domain-specific language that domain experts can adopt to prescribe metadata checking rules, and (2) MeCheck -- a tool that takes in RSL rules and EAs to check for rule violations. With RSL, domain experts (e.g., developers of a Java framework) can specify metadata checking rules by defining content consistency among XML files, annotations, and Java code. Given such RSL rules and a program to scan, MeCheck interprets rules as cross-file static analyzers, which analyzers scan Java and/or XML files to gather information and look for consistency violations. For evaluation, we studied the Spring and JUnit documentation to manually define 15 rules, and created 2 datasets with 115 open-source EAs. The first dataset includes 45 EAs, and the ground truth of 45 manually injected bugs. The second dataset includes multiple versions of 70 EAs. We observed that MeCheck identified bugs in the first dataset with 100% precision, 96% recall, and 98% F-score. It reported 156 bugs in the second dataset, 53 of which bugs were already fixed by developers. Our evaluation shows that MeCheck helps ensure the correct usage of metadata.</p></details> |  |

Software today is often "illegible" - lacking a direct correspondence between code and observed behavior - and insufficiently modular, leading to a failure of three key requirements of robust coding: incrementality (the ability to deliver small increments by making localized changes), integrity (avoiding breaking prior increments) and transparency (making clear what has changed at build time, and what actions have happened at runtime). A new structural pattern offers improved legibility and modularity. Its elements are concepts and synchronizations: fully independent services and event-based rules that mediate between them. A domain-specific language for synchronizations allows behavioral features to be expressed in a granular and declarative way (and thus readily generated by an LLM). A case study of the RealWorld benchmark is used to illustrate and evaluate the approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages.

Prior work has developed sophisticated algorithms to search for concurrency bugs, such as partial order sampling (POS); however, fundamental limitations with existing platforms for concurrency control hinder effective testing of real-world software. We observe that the design space for concurrency control on managed code involves complex trade-offs between expressibility, applicability, and maintainability on the one hand, and bug-finding efficiency on the other hand. This paper presents Fray, a platform for performing push-button concurrency testing of data-race-free JVM programs. The key insight behind Fray is that effective controlled concurrency testing requires orchestrating thread interleavings without replacing existing concurrency primitives, while encoding their semantics for faithfully expressing the set of all possible program behaviors. Fray incorporates a novel concurrency control mechanism called shadow locking, designed to make controlled concurrency testing practical and efficient for JVM programs. In an empirical evaluation on 53 benchmark programs with known bugs (SCTBench and JaConTeBe), Fray with random search finds 70% more bugs than JPF and 77% more bugs than RR's chaos mode. We also demonstrate Fray's push-button applicability on 2,655 tests from Apache Kafka, Lucene, and Google Guava. In these mature projects, Fray successfully discovered 18 real-world concurrency bugs that can cause 363 tests to fail reproducibly.</p></details> |  |

However, reusing poorly understood code can lead to serious problems, such as bugs or security vulnerabilities. To better understand how code comments affect the perceived helpfulness of Stack Overflow answers, we conducted an online experiment simulating a Stack Overflow environment (n=91). The results indicate that both block and inline comments are perceived as significantly more helpful than uncommented source code. Moreover, novices rated code snippets with block comments as more helpful than those with inline comments. Interestingly, other surface features, such as the position of an answer and its answer score, were considered less important. The content of Stack Overflow has been a major source for training large language models. AI-based coding assistants such as GitHub Copilot, which are based on these models, might change the way Stack Overflow is used. However, our findings have implications beyond this specific platform. First, they may help to improve the relevance of community-driven platforms such as Stack Overflow, which provide human advice and explanations of code solutions, complementing AI-based support for software developers. Second, since chat-based AI tools can be prompted to generate code in different ways, knowing which properties influence perceived helpfulness might lead to targeted prompting strategies to generate more readable code snippets.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables, to appear in the Empirical Software Engineering journal</p></details> |

In this paper, we present a large-scale comparison of code authored by human developers and three state-of-the-art LLMs, i.e., ChatGPT, DeepSeek-Coder, and Qwen-Coder, on multiple dimensions of software quality: code defects, security vulnerabilities, and structural complexity. Our evaluation spans over 500k code samples in two widely used languages, Python and Java, classifying defects via Orthogonal Defect Classification and security vulnerabilities using the Common Weakness Enumeration. We find that AI-generated code is generally simpler and more repetitive, yet more prone to unused constructs and hardcoded debugging, while human-written code exhibits greater structural complexity and a higher concentration of maintainability issues. Notably, AI-generated code also contains more high-risk security vulnerabilities. These findings highlight the distinct defect profiles of AI- and human-authored code and underscore the need for specialized quality assurance practices in AI-assisted programming.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 36th IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE, 2025)</p></details> |

Existing approaches rely on branch distances or manually-specified constraints to guide the search; however, the branches alone are often insufficient to precisely characterize progress toward reaching the target states, while the manually specified constraints are often tailored for specific bug types and thus difficult to generalize to diverse target states and programs. We present Locus, a novel framework to improve the efficiency of directed fuzzing. Our key insight is to synthesize predicates to capture fuzzing progress as semantically meaningful intermediate states, serving as milestones towards reaching the target states. When used to instrument the program under fuzzing, they can reject executions unlikely to reach the target states, while providing additional coverage guidance. To automate this task and generalize to diverse programs, Locus features an agentic framework with program analysis tools to synthesize and iteratively refine the candidate predicates, while ensuring the predicates strictly relax the target states to prevent false rejections via symbolic execution. Our evaluation shows that Locus substantially improves the efficiency of eight state-of-the-art fuzzers in discovering real-world vulnerabilities, achieving an average speedup of 41.6x. So far, Locus has found eight previously unpatched bugs, with one already acknowledged with a draft patch.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM as an Execution Estimator: Recovering Missing Dependency for Practical Time-travelling Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18721v4)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose RecovSlicing for computing dynamic data dependency in a single run, with only partial instrumentation. We explore the intuition that LLM can potentially infer program dynamics based on a partially recorded trace and relevant code as its context. Given (1) a partially recorded trace of a program $P$ and (2) the slicing criteria consisting of a query step $s$ and a query variable $v$ read by $s$, RecovSlicing computes the runtime definition of $v$ on the trace by estimating the miss-recorded execution of $P$. In this work, we allow the user to specify implicit query variable, for example, the implicit library variable used in list{\ttfamily .}get(i). Technically, built upon non-deterministic LLM, we address the challenges of (1) precise recovery of runtime variable value and structure from the recorded execution and (2) aligning the memory address of recovered variables and the recorded variables for definition analysis. We extensively evaluate RecovSlicing against the state-of-the-art slicers such as Slicer4J, ND-Slicer, LLM Slicer, and re-execution Slicer on a total number of 8300 data-dependencies over 3 slicing benchmarks. The results show that RecovSlicing can significantly outperform the baselines. The accuracy and recall, achieving 80.3%, 91.1%, and 98.3% on the three benchmarks, whereas the best baseline reaches 39.0%, 82.0%, and 59.9% (accuracy), and 53.4%, 79.1%, and 87.1% (recall), respectively. In addition, we integrate RecovSlicing in a dual-slicing based regression bug localizer, significantly improving its performance by locating 16% more regressions.</p></details> |  |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have made strides in code generation, they struggle to achieve high branch coverage due to their limited ability to reason about intricate control flow structures. To address this limitation, we introduce Panta, a technique that emulates the iterative process human developers follow when analyzing code and constructing test cases. Panta integrates static control flow analysis and dynamic code coverage analysis to systematically guide LLMs in identifying uncovered execution paths and generating better test cases. By incorporating an iterative feedback-driven mechanism, our technique continuously refines test generation based on static and dynamic path coverage insights, ensuring more comprehensive and effective testing. Our empirical evaluation, conducted on classes with high cyclomatic complexity from open-source projects, demonstrates that Panta achieves 26% higher line coverage and 23% higher branch coverage compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in 2026 IEEE/ACM 48th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2026)</p></details> |

However, this flexibility often introduces code quality issues, with prior studies showing that approximately 76% of public notebooks are non-executable, raising significant concerns about reusability. We argue that the traditional notion of executability - requiring a notebook to run fully and without error - is overly rigid, misclassifying many notebooks and overestimating their non-executability. This paper investigates pathological executability issues in public notebooks under varying notions and degrees of executability. Even partially improving executability can improve code comprehension and offer a pathway for dynamic analyses. With this insight, we first categorize notebooks into potentially restorable and pathological non-executable notebooks and then measure how removing misconfiguration and superficial execution issues in notebooks can improve their executability (i.e., additional cells executed without error). In a dataset of 42,546 popular public notebooks containing 34,659 non-executable notebooks, only 21.3% are truly pathologically non-executable. For restorable notebooks, LLM-based methods fully restore 5.4% of previously non-executable notebooks. Among the partially restored, the executability of notebooks improves by 42.7% and 28% by installing the correct modules and generating synthetic data. These findings challenge prior assumptions, suggesting that notebooks have higher executability than previously reported, many of which offer valuable partial execution, and that their executability should be evaluated within the interactive notebook paradigm rather than through traditional software executability standards.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables, the 22nd International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Automated Test Oracles for Flaky Cyber-Physical System Simulators: Approach and Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20902v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulation-based testing of cyber-physical systems (CPS) is costly due to the time-consuming execution of CPS simulators. In addition, CPS simulators may be flaky, leading to inconsistent test outcomes and requiring repeated test re-execution for reliable test verdicts. Automated test oracles that do not require system execution are therefore crucial for reducing testing costs. Ideally, such test oracles should be interpretable to facilitate human understanding of test verdicts, and they must be robust against the potential flakiness of CPS simulators. In this article, we propose assertion-based test oracles for CPS as sets of logical and arithmetic predicates defined over the inputs of the system under test. Given a test input, our assertion-based test oracle determines, without requiring test execution, whether the test passes, fails, or if the oracle is inconclusive in predicting a verdict. We describe two methods for generating assertion-based test oracles: one using genetic programming~(GP) that employs well-known spectrum-based fault localization (SBFL) ranking formulas, namely Ochiai, Tarantula, and Naish, as fitness functions; and the other using decision trees (DT) and decision rules (DR). We evaluate our assertion-based test oracles through case studies in the domains of aerospace, networking and autonomous driving. We show that test oracles generated using GP with Ochiai are significantly more accurate than those obtained using GP with Tarantula and Naish or using DT or DR. Moreover, this accuracy advantage remains even when accounting for the flakiness of the system under test. We further show that the assertion-based test oracles generated by GP with Ochiai are robust against flakiness with only 4% average variation in their accuracy results across four different network and autonomous driving systems with flaky behaviours.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Generate Unit Test via Adversarial Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21107v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unit testing is a core practice in programming, enabling systematic evaluation of programs produced by human developers or large language models (LLMs). Given the challenges in writing comprehensive unit tests, LLMs have been employed to automate test generation, yet methods for training LLMs to produce high-quality tests remain underexplored. In this work, we propose UTRL, a novel reinforcement learning framework that trains an LLM to generate high-quality unit tests given a programming instruction. Our key idea is to iteratively train two LLMs, the unit test generator and the code generator, in an adversarial manner via reinforcement learning. The unit test generator is trained to maximize a discrimination reward, which reflects its ability to produce tests that expose faults in the code generator's solutions, and the code generator is trained to maximize a code reward, which reflects its ability to produce solutions that pass the unit tests generated by the test generator. In our experiments, we demonstrate that unit tests generated by Qwen3-4B trained via UTRL show higher quality compared to unit tests generated by the same model trained via supervised fine-tuning on human-written ground-truth unit tests, yielding code evaluations that more closely align with those induced by the ground-truth tests. Moreover, Qwen3-4B trained with UTRL outperforms frontier models such as GPT-4.1 in generating high-quality unit tests, highlighting the effectiveness of UTRL in training LLMs for this task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at: https://github.com/dgjun32/UTRL</p></details> |
| **[A Time Series Analysis of Malware Uploads to Programming Language Ecosystems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15695v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software ecosystems built around programming languages have greatly facilitated software development. At the same time, their security has increasingly been acknowledged as a problem. To this end, the paper examines the previously overlooked longitudinal aspects of software ecosystem security, focusing on malware uploaded to six popular programming language ecosystems. The dataset examined is based on the new Open Source Vulnerabilities (OSV) database. According to the results, records about detected malware uploads in the database have recently surpassed those addressing vulnerabilities in packages distributed in the ecosystems. In the early 2025 even up to 80% of all entries in the OSV have been about malware. Regarding time series analysis of malware frequencies and their shares to all database entries, good predictions are available already by relatively simple autoregressive models using the numbers of ecosystems, security advisories, and media and other articles as predictors. With these results and the accompanying discussion, the paper improves and advances the understanding of the thus far overlooked longitudinal aspects of ecosystems and malware.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security (ARES 2025), Ghent, Springer, pp. 269-285.

| **[Boosting Skeleton-Driven SMT Solver Fuzzing by Leveraging LLM to Produce Formula Generators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20340v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers are foundational to modern systems and programming languages research, providing the foundation for tasks like symbolic execution and automated verification. Because these solvers sit on the critical path, their correctness is essential, and high-quality test formulas are key to uncovering bugs. However, while prior testing techniques performed well on earlier solver versions, they struggle to keep pace with rapidly evolving features. Recent approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in exploring advanced solver capabilities, but two obstacles remain: nearly half of the generated formulas are syntactically invalid, and iterative interactions with the LLMs introduce substantial computational overhead. In this study, we present Chimera, a novel LLM-assisted fuzzing framework that addresses both issues by shifting from direct formula generation to the synthesis of reusable term (i.e., logical expression) generators. Particularly, Chimera uses LLMs to (1) automatically extract context-free grammars (CFGs) for SMT theories, including solver-specific extensions, from documentation, and (2) synthesize composable Boolean term generators that adhere to these grammars. During fuzzing, Chimera populates structural skeletons derived from existing formulas with the terms iteratively produced by the LLM-synthesized generators. This design ensures syntactic validity while promoting semantic diversity. Notably, Chimera requires only one-time LLM interaction investment, dramatically reducing runtime cost. We evaluated Chimera on two leading SMT solvers: Z3 and cvc5. Our experiments show that Chimera has identified 43 confirmed bugs, 40 of which have already been fixed by developers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Automated Loop Invariant Generation for Complex Programs with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10483v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated program verification has always been an important component of building trustworthy software. While the analysis of real-world programs remains a theoretical challenge, the automation of loop invariant analysis has effectively resolved the problem. However, real-world programs that often mix complex data structures and control flows pose challenges to traditional loop invariant generation tools. To enhance the applicability of invariant generation techniques, we proposed ACInv, an Automated Complex program loop Invariant generation tool, which combines static analysis with Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate the proper loop invariants. We utilize static analysis to extract the necessary information for each loop and embed it into prompts for the LLM to generate invariants for each loop. Subsequently, we employ an LLM-based evaluator to assess the generated invariants, refining them by either strengthening, weakening, or rejecting them based on their correctness, ultimately obtaining enhanced invariants. We conducted experiments on ACInv, which showed that ACInv outperformed previous tools on data sets with data structures, and maintained similar performance to the state-of-the-art tool AutoSpec on numerical programs without data structures. For the total data set, ACInv can solve 21% more examples than AutoSpec and can generate reference data structure templates.</p></details> | 26 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Detecting Metadata-Related Bugs in Enterprise Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14463v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When building enterprise applications (EAs) on Java frameworks (e.g., Spring), developers often configure application components via metadata (i.e., Java annotations and XML files). It is challenging for developers to correctly use metadata, because the usage rules can be complex and existing tools provide limited assistance. When developers misuse metadata, EAs become misconfigured, which defects can trigger erroneous runtime behaviors or introduce security vulnerabilities. To help developers correctly use metadata, this paper presents (1) RSL -- a domain-specific language that domain experts can adopt to prescribe metadata checking rules, and (2) MeCheck -- a tool that takes in RSL rules and EAs to check for rule violations. With RSL, domain experts (e.g., developers of a Java framework) can specify metadata checking rules by defining content consistency among XML files, annotations, and Java code. Given such RSL rules and a program to scan, MeCheck interprets rules as cross-file static analyzers, which analyzers scan Java and/or XML files to gather information and look for consistency violations. For evaluation, we studied the Spring and JUnit documentation to manually define 15 rules, and created 2 datasets with 115 open-source EAs. The first dataset includes 45 EAs, and the ground truth of 45 manually injected bugs. The second dataset includes multiple versions of 70 EAs. We observed that MeCheck identified bugs in the first dataset with 100% precision, 96% recall, and 98% F-score. It reported 156 bugs in the second dataset, 53 of which bugs were already fixed by developers. Our evaluation shows that MeCheck helps ensure the correct usage of metadata.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hallucination to Consensus: Multi-Agent LLMs for End-to-End Test Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02943v5)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unit testing plays a critical role in ensuring software correctness. However, writing unit tests manually is labor-intensive, especially for strongly typed languages like Java, motivating the need for automated approaches. Traditional methods primarily rely on search-based or randomized algorithms to achieve high code coverage and produce regression oracles, which are derived from the program's current behavior rather than its intended functionality. Recent advances in LLMs have enabled oracle generation from natural language descriptions, aligning better with user requirements. However, existing LLM-based methods often require fine-tuning or rely on external tools such as EvoSuite for test prefix generation, making them costly or cumbersome to apply in practice. In this work, we propose CANDOR, a novel prompt engineering-based LLM framework for automated unit test generation in Java. CANDOR orchestrates multiple specialized LLM agents to collaboratively generate complete tests. To mitigate the notorious hallucinations in LLMs and improve oracle correctness, we introduce a novel strategy that engages multiple reasoning LLMs in a panel discussion and generates accurate oracles based on consensus. Additionally, to reduce the verbosity of reasoning LLMs' outputs, we propose a novel dual-LLM pipeline to produce concise and structured oracle evaluations. Our experiments show that CANDOR is comparable with EvoSuite in generating tests with high code coverage and clearly superior in terms of mutation score. Moreover, our prompt engineering-based approach CANDOR significantly outperforms the SOTA fine-tuning-based oracle generator TOGLL by at least 21.1 percentage points in oracle correctness on both correct and faulty source code. Further ablation studies confirm the critical contributions of key agents in generating high-quality tests.</p></details> |  |

SmartIntentNN is a deep learning model specifically designed to identify unsafe intents in smart contracts. This model integrates the Universal Sentence Encoder, a K-means clustering-based intent highlighting mechanism, and a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network for multi-label classification, achieving an F1 of 0.8633 in distinguishing ten different intent categories. In this study, we present an upgraded version of this model, SmartIntentNN2 (Smart Contract Intent Neural Network V2). A significant enhancement in V2 is the incorporation of a BERT-based pre-trained language model, which has been trained on a dataset of 16,000 real smart contracts using a Masked Language Modeling objective. SmartIntentNN2 retains the BiLSTM-based multi-label classification network. With an improved F1 of 0.927, V2 demonstrates enhanced performance compared to its predecessor, establishing itself as the state-of-the-art model for smart contract intent detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, conference</p></details> |

Prior work has developed sophisticated algorithms to search for concurrency bugs, such as partial order sampling (POS); however, fundamental limitations with existing platforms for concurrency control hinder effective testing of real-world software. We observe that the design space for concurrency control on managed code involves complex trade-offs between expressibility, applicability, and maintainability on the one hand, and bug-finding efficiency on the other hand. This paper presents Fray, a platform for performing push-button concurrency testing of data-race-free JVM programs. The key insight behind Fray is that effective controlled concurrency testing requires orchestrating thread interleavings without replacing existing concurrency primitives, while encoding their semantics for faithfully expressing the set of all possible program behaviors. Fray incorporates a novel concurrency control mechanism called shadow locking, designed to make controlled concurrency testing practical and efficient for JVM programs. In an empirical evaluation on 53 benchmark programs with known bugs (SCTBench and JaConTeBe), Fray with random search finds 70% more bugs than JPF and 77% more bugs than RR's chaos mode. We also demonstrate Fray's push-button applicability on 2,655 tests from Apache Kafka, Lucene, and Google Guava. In these mature projects, Fray successfully discovered 18 real-world concurrency bugs that can cause 363 tests to fail reproducibly.</p></details> |  |

However, current benchmarks primarily emphasize functional relevance while neglecting critical dimensions of software quality. Motivated by this gap, we introduce CoQuIR, the first large-scale, multilingual benchmark specifically designed to evaluate quality-aware code retrieval across four key dimensions: correctness, efficiency, security, and maintainability. CoQuIR provides fine-grained quality annotations for 42,725 queries and 134,907 code snippets in 11 programming languages, and is accompanied by two quality-centric evaluation metrics: Pairwise Preference Accuracy and Margin-based Ranking Score. Using CoQuIR, we benchmark 23 retrieval models, covering both open-source and proprietary systems, and find that even top-performing models frequently fail to distinguish buggy or insecure code from their more robust counterparts. Furthermore, we conduct preliminary investigations into training methods that explicitly encourage retrievers to recognize code quality. Using synthetic datasets, we demonstrate promising improvements in quality-aware metrics across various models, without sacrificing semantic relevance. Downstream code generation experiments further validate the effectiveness of our approach. Overall, our work highlights the importance of integrating quality signals into code retrieval systems, laying the groundwork for more trustworthy and robust software development tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Functional Consistency of LLM Code Embeddings: A Self-Evolving Data Synthesis Framework for Benchmarking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19558v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embedding models have demonstrated strong performance in tasks like clustering, retrieval, and feature extraction while offering computational advantages over generative models and cross-encoders. Benchmarks such as MTEB have shown that text embeddings from large language models (LLMs) capture rich semantic information, but their ability to reflect code-level functional semantics remains unclear. Existing studies largely focus on code clone detection, which emphasizes syntactic similarity and overlooks functional understanding. In this paper, we focus on the functional consistency of LLM code embeddings, which determines if two code snippets perform the same function regardless of syntactic differences. We propose a novel data synthesis framework called Functionality-Oriented Code Self-Evolution to construct diverse and challenging benchmarks. Specifically, we define code examples across four semantic and syntactic categories and find that existing datasets predominantly capture syntactic properties. Our framework generates four unique variations from a single code instance, providing a broader spectrum of code examples that better reflect functional differences. Extensive experiments on three downstream tasks-code clone detection, code functional consistency identification, and code retrieval-demonstrate that embedding models significantly improve their performance when trained on our evolved datasets. These results highlight the effectiveness and generalization of our data synthesis framework, advancing the functional understanding of code.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Slice-Based Change Impact Analysis for Regression Test Case Prioritization of Object-Oriented Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19056v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test case prioritization focuses on finding a suitable order of execution of the test cases in a test suite to meet some performance goals like detecting faults early. It is likely that some test cases execute the program parts that are more prone to errors and will detect more errors if executed early during the testing process. Finding an optimal order of execution for the selected regression test cases saves time and cost of retesting. This paper presents a static approach to prioritizing the test cases by computing the affected component coupling (ACC) of the affected parts of object-oriented programs. We construct a graph named affected slice graph (ASG) to represent these affected program parts.We determine the fault-proneness of the nodes of ASG by computing their respective ACC values. We assign higher priority to those test cases that cover the nodes with higher ACC values. Our analysis with mutation faults shows that the test cases executing the fault-prone program parts have a higher chance to reveal faults earlier than other test cases in the test suite. The result obtained from seven case studies justifies that our approach is feasible and gives acceptable performance in comparison to some existing techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interleaving Large Language Models for Compiler Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18955v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Testing compilers with AI models, especially large language models (LLMs), has shown great promise. However, current approaches struggle with two key problems: The generated programs for testing compilers are often too simple, and extensive testing with the LLMs is computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a novel compiler testing framework that decouples the testing process into two distinct phases: an offline phase and an online phase. In the offline phase, we use LLMs to generate a collection of small but feature-rich code pieces. In the online phase, we reuse these code pieces by strategically combining them to build high-quality and valid test programs, which are then used to test compilers. We implement this idea in a tool, LegoFuzz, for testing C compilers. The results are striking: we found 66 bugs in GCC and LLVM, the most widely used C compilers. Almost half of the bugs are miscompilation bugs, which are serious and hard-to-find bugs that none of the existing LLM-based tools could find. We believe this efficient design opens up new possibilities for using AI models in software testing beyond just C compilers.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing approaches focus on mainstream languages such as Python and Java, neglecting the Solidity language, the predominant programming language for Ethereum smart contracts. Due to the lack of adequate benchmarks for Solidity, LLMs' ability to generate secure, cost-effective smart contracts remains unexplored. To fill this gap, we construct SolEval, the first repository-level benchmark designed for Solidity smart contract generation, to evaluate the performance of LLMs on Solidity. SolEval consists of 1,507 samples from 28 different repositories, covering 6 popular domains, providing LLMs with a comprehensive evaluation benchmark. Unlike the existing Solidity benchmark, SolEval not only includes complex function calls but also reflects the real-world complexity of the Ethereum ecosystem by incorporating Gas@k and Vul@k. We evaluate 16 LLMs on SolEval, and our results show that the best-performing LLM achieves only 26.29% Pass@10, highlighting substantial room for improvement in Solidity code generation by LLMs. Additionally, we conduct supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on Qwen-7B using SolEval, resulting in a significant performance improvement, with Pass@5 increasing from 16.67% to 58.33%, demonstrating the effectiveness of fine-tuning LLMs on our benchmark.

However, since existing approaches either demand the existence of multi-line similar code or randomly reference existing code, they can only repair a small number of bugs with many incorrect patches, hindering their wide application in practice. In this work, we aim to improve the effectiveness of redundancy-based APRs by exploring more effective source code reuse methods for improving the number of correct patches and reducing incorrect patches. Specifically, we have proposed a new repair technique named Repatt, which incorporates a two-level pattern mining process for guiding effective patch generation (i.e., token and expression levels). We have conducted an extensive experiment on the widely-used Defects4J benchmark and compared Repatt with ten state-of-the-art APR approaches. The results show that it complements existing approaches by repairing 9 unique bugs compared with the latest Large Language Model (LLM)-based and deep learning-based methods and 19 unique bugs compared with traditional repair methods when providing the perfect fault localization. In addition, when the perfect fault localization is unknown in real practice, Repatt significantly outperforms the baseline approaches by achieving much higher patch precision, i.e., 83.8\%, although it repairs fewer bugs. Moreover, we further proposed an effective patch ranking strategy for combining the strength of Repatt and the baseline methods. The result shows that it repairs 124 bugs when only considering the Top-1 patches and improves the best-performing repair method by repairing 39 more bugs. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for practical use.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ICSME 2025</p></details> |

Much public attention has been transfixed on the topic of code generation from Large Language Models (LLMs) via a prompt. However, software engineering is much more than programming, and AI agents go far beyond instructions given by a prompt. At the code level, common software tasks include code generation, testing, and program repair. Design level software tasks may include architecture exploration, requirements understanding, and requirements enforcement at the code level. Each of these software tasks involves micro-decisions which can be taken autonomously by an AI agent, aided by program analysis tools. This creates the vision of an AI software engineer, where the AI agent can be seen as a member of a development team. Conceptually, the key to successfully developing trustworthy agentic AI-based software workflows will be to resolve the core difficulty in software engineering - the deciphering and clarification of developer intent. Specification inference, or deciphering the intent, thus lies at the heart of many software tasks, including software maintenance and program repair. A successful deployment of agentic technology into software engineering would involve making conceptual progress in such intent inference via agents. Trusting the AI agent becomes a key aspect, as software engineering becomes more automated. Higher automation also leads to higher volume of code being automatically generated, and then integrated into code-bases. Thus to deal with this explosion, an emerging direction is AI-based verification and validation (V & V) of AI generated code. We posit that agentic software workflows in future will include such AIbased V&V.</p></details> | 4 pages |

Clearly, a misalignment between how LLMs and programmers comprehend code can lead to misunderstandings, inefficiencies, low code quality, and bugs. A key question in this space is whether humans and LLMs are confused by the same kind of code. This would not only guide our choices of integrating LLMs in software engineering workflows, but also inform about possible improvements of LLMs. To this end, we conducted an empirical study comparing an LLM to human programmers comprehending clean and confusing code. We operationalized comprehension for the LLM by using LLM perplexity, and for human programmers using neurophysiological responses (in particular, EEG-based fixation-related potentials). We found that LLM perplexity spikes correlate both in terms of location and amplitude with human neurophysiological responses that indicate confusion. This result suggests that LLMs and humans are similarly confused about the code. Based on these findings, we devised a data-driven, LLM-based approach to identify regions of confusion in code that elicit confusion in human programmers.</p></details> |  |

We present TableTalk, a spreadsheet programming agent embodying three design principles -- scaffolding, flexibility, and incrementality -- derived from studies with seven spreadsheet programmers and 85 Excel templates. TableTalk guides programmers through structured plans based on professional workflows, generating three potential next steps to adapt plans to programmer needs. It uses pre-defined tools to generate spreadsheet components and incrementally build spreadsheets. In a study with 20 programmers, TableTalk produced higher-quality spreadsheets 2.3 times more likely to be preferred than the baseline. It reduced cognitive load and thinking time by 12.6%. From this, we derive design guidelines for agentic spreadsheet programming tools and discuss implications on spreadsheet programming, end-user programming, AI-assisted programming, and human-agent collaboration.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, effective and efficient debugging is one of the core skills a software engineer must develop. However, the teaching of debugging techniques is usually very limited or only taught in indirect ways, e.g., during software projects. As a result, most Computer Science (CS) students learn debugging only in an ad-hoc and unstructured way. In this work, we present our approach called Simulated Interactive Debugging that interactively guides students along the debugging process. The guidance aims to empower the students to repair their solutions and have a proper learning experience. We envision that such guided debugging techniques can be integrated into programming courses early in the CS education curriculum. We developed a prototypical implementation using traditional fault localization techniques and large language models. Students can use features like the automated setting of breakpoints or an interactive chatbot. We designed and executed a small-scale, controlled experiment with eight undergraduate CS students. Based on the responses, we conclude that the participants liked the systematic guidance. They rated the automated setting of breakpoints as most effective, followed by the interactive debugging and chatting, and the breakpoint explanations. In future, we will extend our concept and implementation, and perform more intensive user studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the NIER track of the 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, ASE-NIER 2025</p></details> |

Search-based GI excels at navigating large program spaces, but operates primarily at the syntactic level. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) offer semantic-aware edits, yet lack goal-directed feedback and control (which is instead a strength of GI). As such, we propose the investigation of a new research line on AI-powered GI aimed at incorporating semantic aware search. We take a first step at it by augmenting GI with the use of automated clustering of LLM edits. We provide initial empirical evidence that our proposal, dubbed PatchCat, allows us to automatically and effectively categorize LLM-suggested patches. PatchCat identified 18 different types of software patches and categorized newly suggested patches with high accuracy. It also enabled detecting NoOp edits in advance and, prospectively, to skip test suite execution to save resources in many cases. These results, coupled with the fact that PatchCat works with small, local LLMs, are a promising step toward interpretable, efficient, and green GI. We outline a rich agenda of future work and call for the community to join our vision of building a principled understanding of LLM-driven mutations, guiding the GI search process with semantic signals.</p></details> |  |

Even when using open-source tools, programming skills are essential to modify built-in models. This can be particularly challenging for domain experts who lack coding proficiency. This paper introduces modelSolver, a software solution with a new framework centered around symbolic mathematical modeling. The proposed paradigm facilitates defining models through intuitive mathematical expressions, thus eliminating the need for traditional programming constructs such as arrays, loops, and sparse matrix computations. The modelSolver focuses on power flow and state estimation using an open-box approach, which allows users to specify custom models using either real or complex variables. Unlike existing tools that rely on hard-coded models, modelSolver enables the representation of a wide range of advanced functionalities, including power flow with voltage regulators and load tap changers, continuation power flow, and Gauss-Newton state estimation with equality constraints. Compatibility with MATPOWER is ensured via a converter that automates importing data files. The framework prioritizes model-driven development and empowers domain experts to focus on power system modeling without programming barriers. It aims to simplify power system computations, making them more accessible to students, scientists, and practitioners.</p></details> |  |
| **[RepoTransAgent: Multi-Agent LLM Framework for Repository-Aware Code Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17720v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Repository-aware code translation is critical for modernizing legacy systems, enhancing maintainability, and enabling interoperability across diverse programming languages. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have improved code translation quality, existing approaches face significant challenges in practical scenarios: insufficient contextual understanding, inflexible prompt designs, and inadequate error correction mechanisms. These limitations severely hinder accurate and efficient translation of complex, real-world code repositories. To address these challenges, we propose RepoTransAgent, a novel multi-agent LLM framework for repository-aware code translation. RepoTransAgent systematically decomposes the translation process into specialized subtasks-context retrieval, dynamic prompt construction, and iterative code refinement-each handled by dedicated agents. Our approach leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for contextual information gathering, employs adaptive prompts tailored to varying repository scenarios, and introduces a reflection-based mechanism for systematic error correction. We evaluate RepoTransAgent on hundreds of Java-C# translation pairs from six popular open-source projects. Experimental results demonstrate that RepoTransAgent significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both compile and pass rates. Specifically, RepoTransAgent achieves up to 55.34% compile rate and 45.84% pass rate. Comprehensive analysis confirms the robustness and generalizability of RepoTransAgent across different LLMs, establishing its effectiveness for real-world repository-aware code translation.</p></details> |  |

A critical step in FPGA development is logic synthesis, which enables developers to translate their software designs into hardware net lists, which facilitates the physical implementation of the chip, detailed timing and power analysis, gate-level simulation, test vector generation, and optimization and consistency checking. However, bugs or incorrect implementations in FPGA logic synthesis compilers may lead to unexpected behaviors in target wapplications, posing security risks. Therefore, it is crucial to eliminate such bugs in FPGA logic synthesis compilers. The effectiveness of existing works is still limited by its simple, blind mutation strategy. To address this challenge, we propose a guided mutation strategy based on Bayesian optimization called LSC-Fuzz to detect bugs in FPGA logic synthesis compilers. Specifically, LSC-Fuzz consists of three components: the test-program generation component, the Bayesian diversity selection component, and the equivalent check component. By performing test-program generation and Bayesian diversity selection, LSC-Fuzz generates diverse and complex HDL code, thoroughly testing the FPGA logic synthesis compilers using equivalent check to detect bugs. Through three months, LSC-Fuzz has found 16 bugs, 12 of these has been confirmed by official technical support.</p></details> |  |

(R Vs Python) - An Exploratory Study on Energy Consumption of Machine Learning Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17344v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The utilization of Machine Learning (ML) in contemporary software systems is extensive and continually expanding. However, its usage is energy-intensive, contributing to increased carbon emissions and demanding significant resources. While numerous studies examine the performance and accuracy of ML, only a limited few focus on its environmental aspects, particularly energy consumption. In addition, despite emerging efforts to compare energy consumption across various programming languages for specific algorithms and tasks, there remains a gap specifically in comparing these languages for ML-based tasks. This paper aims to raise awareness of the energy costs associated with employing different programming languages for ML model training and inference. Through this empirical study, we measure and compare the energy consumption along with run-time performance of five regression and five classification tasks implemented in Python and R, the two most popular programming languages in this context. Our study results reveal a statistically significant difference in costs between the two languages in 95% of the cases examined. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that the choice of programming language can influence energy efficiency significantly, up to 99.16% during model training and up to 99.8% during inferences, for a given ML task.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages including references, 5 figures</p></details> |

Unlocking the Power of Feedback-Driven Deep Learning Framework Fuzzing via LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17642v3)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Learning (DL) frameworks have served as fundamental components in DL systems over the last decade. However, bugs in DL frameworks could lead to catastrophic consequences in critical scenarios. A simple yet effective way to find bugs in DL frameworks is fuzz testing (Fuzzing). Existing approaches focus on test generation, leaving execution results with high semantic value (e.g., coverage information, bug reports, and exception logs) in the wild, which can serve as multiple types of feedback. To fill this gap, we propose FUEL to effectively utilize the feedback information, which comprises two Large Language Models (LLMs): analysis LLM and generation LLM. Specifically, analysis LLM infers analysis summaries from feedback information, while the generation LLM creates tests guided by these summaries. Furthermore, based on multiple feedback guidance, we design two additional components: (i) a feedback-aware simulated annealing algorithm to select operators for test generation, enriching test diversity. (ii) a program self-repair strategy to automatically repair invalid tests, enhancing test validity. We evaluate FUEL on the two most popular DL frameworks, and experiment results show that FUEL can improve line code coverage of PyTorch and TensorFlow by 9.15% and 14.70% over state-of-the-art baselines (e.g., TitanFuzz and WhiteFox). By the time of submission, FUEL has detected 104 previously unknown bugs for PyTorch and TensorFlow, with 93 confirmed as new bugs, 49 already fixed, and 14 assigned CVE IDs. Our artifact is available at https://github.com/NJU-iSE/FUEL</p></details> |  |
| **[Source Code Summarization in the Era of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07959v2)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To support software developers in understanding and maintaining programs, various automatic (source) code summarization techniques have been proposed to generate a concise natural language summary (i.e., comment) for a given code snippet. Recently, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has led to a great boost in the performance of code-related tasks. In this paper, we undertake a systematic and comprehensive study on code summarization in the era of LLMs, which covers multiple aspects involved in the workflow of LLM-based code summarization. Specifically, we begin by examining prevalent automated evaluation methods for assessing the quality of summaries generated by LLMs and find that the results of the GPT-4 evaluation method are most closely aligned with human evaluation. Then, we explore the effectiveness of five prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, critique, and expert) in adapting LLMs to code summarization tasks. Contrary to expectations, advanced prompting techniques may not outperform simple zero-shot prompting. Next, we investigate the impact of LLMs' model settings (including top\_p and temperature parameters) on the quality of generated summaries. We find the impact of the two parameters on summary quality varies by the base LLM and programming language, but their impacts are similar. Moreover, we canvass LLMs' abilities to summarize code snippets in distinct types of programming languages. The results reveal that LLMs perform suboptimally when summarizing code written in logic programming languages compared to other language types. Finally, we unexpectedly find that CodeLlama-Instruct with 7B parameters can outperform advanced GPT-4 in generating summaries describing code implementation details and asserting code properties. We hope that our findings can provide a comprehensive understanding of code summarization in the era of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 47th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2025)</p></details> |

However, in the current NISQ era (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices), the available hardware presents several limitations, such as a limited number of qubits, high error rates, and reduced coherence times. Efficient management of quantum resources, both physical (qubits, error rates, connectivity) and logical (quantum gates, algorithms, error correction), becomes particularly relevant in the design and deployment of quantum algorithms. In this work, we analyze the role of resources in the various uses of NISQ devices today, identifying their relevance and implications for software engineering focused on the use of quantum computers. We propose a vision for runtime-aware quantum software development, identifying key challenges to its realization, such as limited introspection capabilities and temporal constraints in current platforms. As a proof of concept, we introduce Qonscious, a prototype framework that enables conditional execution of quantum programs based on dynamic resource evaluation. With this contribution, we aim to strengthen the field of Quantum Resource Estimation (QRE) and move towards the development of scalable, reliable, and resource-aware quantum software.</p></details> |  |
| **[HoarePrompt: Structural Reasoning About Program Correctness in Natural Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19599v2)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While software requirements are often expressed in natural language, verifying the correctness of a program against such requirements is a hard and underexplored problem. Large language models (LLMs) are promising candidates for addressing this challenge, however our experience shows that they are ineffective in this task, often failing to detect even straightforward bugs. To address this gap, we introduce HoarePrompt, a novel approach that adapts fundamental ideas from program verification to natural language artifacts. Inspired from the strongest postcondition calculus, HoarePrompt employs a systematic, step-by-step process in which an LLM generates natural language descriptions of reachable program states at various code points. To manage loops, we propose few-shot-driven k-induction, an adaptation of the k-induction method widely used in model checking. Once program states are described, HoarePrompt leverages the LLM to assess whether the program, annotated with these state descriptions, conforms to the natural language requirements. For evaluating the quality of classifiers of program correctness with respect to natural language requirements, we constructed CoCoClaNeL, a challenging dataset of solutions to programming competition problems. Our experiments show that HoarePrompt improves the MCC by 61% compared to directly using Zero-shot-CoT prompts for correctness classification. Furthermore, HoarePrompt outperforms a classifier that assesses correctness via LLM-based test generation by an MCC increase of 106%. The inductive reasoning mechanism contributes a 26% boost to MCC, underscoring its effectiveness in managing loops.</p></details> |  |
| **[On systematic construction of correct logic programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16782v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partial correctness of imperative or functional programming divides in logic programming into two notions. Correctness means that all answers of the program are compatible with the specification. Completeness means that the program produces all the answers required by the specifications. We also consider semi-completeness -- completeness for those queries for which the program does not diverge. This paper presents an approach to systematically construct provably correct and semi-complete logic programs, for a given specification. Normal programs are considered, under Kunen's 3-valued completion semantics (of negation as finite failure) and the well-founded semantics (of negation as possibly infinite failure). The approach is declarative, it abstracts from details of operational semantics, like e.g.\ the form of the selected literals (``procedure calls'') during the computation. The proposed method is simple, and can be used (maybe informally) in actual everyday programming.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages.

GPS treats the task of model checking a program as a directed search of the program states, guided by a compositional, summary-based static analysis. The summaries produced by static analysis are used both to prune away infeasible paths and to drive test generation to reach new, unexplored program states. GPS can find both proofs of safety and counter-examples to safety (i.e., inputs that trigger bugs), and features a novel two-layered search strategy that renders it particularly efficient at finding bugs in programs featuring long, input-dependent error paths. To make GPS refutationally complete (in the sense that it will find an error if one exists, if it is allotted enough time), we introduce an instrumentation technique and show that it helps GPS achieve refutation-completeness without sacrificing overall performance. We benchmarked GPS on a suite of benchmarks including both programs from the Software Verification Competition (SV-COMP) and from prior literature, and found that our implementation of GPS outperforms state-of-the-art software model checkers (including the top performers in SV-COMP ReachSafety-Loops category), both in terms of the number of benchmarks solved and in terms of running time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of paper in OOPSLA 2025 (with updated evaluations section compared to v1 manuscript). 37 pages</p></details> |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in mitigating this effort, existing LLM-based automated debugging methods underperform on industrial-scale modules. A major reason for this is bug signal dilution in long contexts, where a few bug-relevant tokens are overwhelmed by hundreds of unrelated lines, diffusing the model's attention. To address this issue, we introduce ARSP, a two-stage system that mitigates dilution via semantics-guided fragmentation. A Partition LLM splits a module into semantically tight fragments; a Repair LLM patches each fragment; edits are merged without altering unrelated logic. A synthetic data framework generates fragment-level training pairs spanning bug types, design styles, and scales to supervise both models. Experiments show that ARSP achieves 77.92% pass@1 and 83.88% pass@5, outperforming mainstream commercial LLMs including Claude-3.7 and SOTA automated Verilog debugging tools Strider and MEIC. Also, semantic partitioning improves pass@1 by 11.6% and pass@5 by 10.2% over whole-module debugging, validating the effectiveness of fragment-level scope reduction in LLM-based Verilog debugging.</p></details> |  |

Agile methodologies are replacing traditional approaches such as Waterfall, where flexibility, iterative development and adaptation to change are favoured over rigid planning and execution. DevOps, a subsequent evolution from Agile, emphasises collaborative efforts in development and operations teams, focusing on continuous integration and deployment to deliver resilient and high-quality software products and services. This study aims to critically assess both Agile and DevOps practices in the IT industry to identify the feasibility and applicability of Agile methods in DevOps practices. Eleven semi-structured interviews were conducted with Agile and DevOps practitioners in varying capacities across several sectors within the IT industry. Through thematic analysis, 51 unique codes were extracted and synthesised into 19 themes that reported on each phase of the DevOps lifecycle, specifically regarding the integration and implementation of Agile methods into DevOps practices. Based on the findings, a new understanding detailing the interrelationship of Agile methods in DevOps practices was discussed that met the research objectives.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 2 figures, conference</p></details> |

However, when the system operates in dynamic environments, the workload variations, hardware changes, and system updates will inevitably introduce concept drifts at different levels - global drifts, which reshape the performance landscape of the entire configuration space; and local drifts, which only affect certain sub-regions of that space. As such, existing offline and transfer learning approaches can struggle to adapt to these implicit and unpredictable changes in real-time, rendering configuration performance learning challenging. To address this, we propose DHDA, an online configuration performance learning framework designed to capture and adapt to these drifts at different levels. The key idea is that DHDA adapts to both the local and global drifts using dually hierarchical adaptation: at the upper level, we redivide the data into different divisions, within each of which the local model is retrained, to handle global drifts only when necessary. At the lower level, the local models of the divisions can detect local drifts and adapt themselves asynchronously. To balance responsiveness and efficiency, DHDA combines incremental updates with periodic full retraining to minimize redundant computation when no drifts are detected. Through evaluating eight software systems and against state-of-the-art approaches, we show that DHDA achieves considerably better accuracy and can effectively adapt to drifts with up to 2x improvements, while incurring reasonable overhead and is able to improve different local models in handling concept drift.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICSE 2026</p></details> |
| **[Complete the Cycle: Reachability Types with Expressive Cyclic References (Extended Version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07328v3)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Local reasoning about programs that combine aliasing and mutable state is a longstanding challenge. Existing approaches -- ownership systems, linear and affine types, uniqueness types, and lexical effect tracking -- impose global restrictions such as uniqueness or linearity, or rely on shallow syntactic analyses. These designs fall short with higher-order functions and shared mutable state. Reachability Types (RT) track aliasing and separation in higher-order programs, ensuring runtime safety and non-interference. However, RT systems face three key limitations: (1) they prohibit cyclic references, ruling out non-terminating computations and fixed-point combinators; (2) they require deep tracking, where a qualifier must include all transitively reachable locations, reducing precision and hindering optimizations like fine-grained parallelism; and (3) referent qualifier invariance prevents referents from escaping their allocation contexts, making reference factories inexpressible. In this work, we address these limitations by extending RT with three mechanisms that enhance expressiveness. First, we introduce cyclic references, enabling recursive patterns to be encoded directly through the store. Second, we adopt shallow qualifier tracking, decoupling references from their transitively reachable values. Finally, we introduce an escaping rule with reference subtyping, allowing referent qualifiers to outlive their allocation context. These extensions are formalized in the $\mathsf{F}_{<:}^{\circ}$-calculus with a mechanized proof of type soundness, and case studies illustrate expressiveness through fixpoint combinators, non-interfering parallelism, and escaping read-only references.</p></details> |  |

However, their heavy reliance on large amounts of data, often collected from unsanitized online sources, exposes them to data poisoning attacks, where adversaries inject malicious samples to subtly bias model behavior. Recent targeted attacks silently replace secure code with semantically equivalent but vulnerable implementations without relying on explicit triggers to launch the attack, making it especially hard for detection methods to distinguish clean from poisoned samples. We present a systematic study on the effectiveness of existing poisoning detection methods under this stealthy threat model. Specifically, we perform targeted poisoning on three DL models (CodeBERT, CodeT5+, AST-T5), and evaluate spectral signatures analysis, activation clustering, and static analysis as defenses. Our results show that all methods struggle to detect triggerless poisoning, with representation-based approaches failing to isolate poisoned samples and static analysis suffering false positives and false negatives, highlighting the need for more robust, trigger-independent defenses for AI-assisted code generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 3rd IEEE International Workshop on Reliable and Secure AI for Software Engineering (ReSAISE, 2025), co-located with ISSRE 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we present a large-scale comparison of code authored by human developers and three state-of-the-art LLMs, i.e., ChatGPT, DeepSeek-Coder, and Qwen-Coder, on multiple dimensions of software quality: code defects, security vulnerabilities, and structural complexity. Our evaluation spans over 500k code samples in two widely used languages, Python and Java, classifying defects via Orthogonal Defect Classification and security vulnerabilities using the Common Weakness Enumeration. We find that AI-generated code is generally simpler and more repetitive, yet more prone to unused constructs and hardcoded debugging, while human-written code exhibits greater structural complexity and a higher concentration of maintainability issues. Notably, AI-generated code also contains more high-risk security vulnerabilities. These findings highlight the distinct defect profiles of AI- and human-authored code and underscore the need for specialized quality assurance practices in AI-assisted programming.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 36th IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE, 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Reusable Test Suites for Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21553v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) agents show great promise in solving sequential decision-making tasks. However, validating the reliability and performance of the agent policies' behavior for deployment remains challenging. Most reinforcement learning policy testing methods produce test suites tailored to the agent policy being tested, and their relevance to other policies is unclear. This work presents Multi-Policy Test Case Selection (MPTCS), a novel automated test suite selection method for RL environments, designed to extract test cases generated by any policy testing framework based on their solvability, diversity, and general difficulty. MPTCS uses a set of policies to select a diverse collection of reusable policy-agnostic test cases that reveal typical flaws in the agents' behavior. The set of policies selects test cases from a candidate pool, which can be generated by any policy testing method, based on a difficulty score. We assess the effectiveness of the difficulty score and how the method's effectiveness and cost depend on the number of policies in the set. Additionally, a method for promoting diversity in the test suite, a discretized general test case descriptor surface inspired by quality-diversity algorithms, is examined to determine how it covers the state space and which policies it triggers to produce faulty behaviors.</p></details> |  |

However, existing frameworks continue to suffer from the propagation of incorrect facts. A major limitation stems from their insufficient semantic understanding of code, resulting in overly conservative treatment of user-defined functions. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) present new opportunities to bridge this gap. In this paper, we propose LMPA (LLM-enhanced Pointer Analysis), a vision that integrates LLMs into pointer analysis to enhance both precision and scalability. LMPA identifies user-defined functions that resemble system APIs and models them accordingly, thereby mitigating erroneous cross-calling-context propagation. Furthermore, it enhances summary-based analysis by inferring initial points-to sets and introducing a novel summary strategy augmented with natural language. Finally, we discuss the key challenges involved in realizing this vision.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by LMPL 2025</p></details> |

While state-of-the-art Software Engineering ( SE) agents like OpenHands or Cursor use LLM-based summarization to tackle this issue, it is unclear whether the increased complexity offers tangible performance benefits compared to simply omitting older observations. We present a systematic comparison of these strategies within SWE-agent on SWE-bench Verified across five diverse model configurations. We find that a simple observation-masking strategy halves cost relative to a raw agent while matching, and sometimes slightly exceeding, the solve rate of LLM summarization. For example, with Qwen3-Coder 480B, masking improves solve rate from 53.8% (raw agent) to 54.8%, while remaining competitive with summarization at a lower cost.

| **[RepoMark: A Code Usage Auditing Framework for Code Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21432v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation has transformed software development by automating coding tasks with unprecedented efficiency. However, the training of these models on open-source code repositories (e.g., from GitHub) raises critical ethical and legal concerns, particularly regarding data authorization and open-source license compliance. Developers are increasingly questioning whether model trainers have obtained proper authorization before using repositories for training, especially given the lack of transparency in data collection. To address these concerns, we propose a novel data marking framework RepoMark to audit the data usage of code LLMs. Our method enables repository owners to verify whether their code has been used in training, while ensuring semantic preservation, imperceptibility, and theoretical false detection rate (FDR) guarantees. By generating multiple semantically equivalent code variants, RepoMark introduces data marks into the code files, and during detection, RepoMark leverages a novel ranking-based hypothesis test to detect memorization within the model. Compared to prior data auditing approaches, RepoMark significantly enhances sample efficiency, allowing effective auditing even when the user's repository possesses only a small number of code files. Experiments demonstrate that RepoMark achieves a detection success rate over 90\% on small code repositories under a strict FDR guarantee of 5\%. This represents a significant advancement over existing data marking techniques, all of which only achieve accuracy below 55\% under identical settings. This further validates RepoMark as a robust, theoretically sound, and promising solution for enhancing transparency in code LLM training, which can safeguard the rights of repository owners.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Study of Vulnerable Package Dependencies in LLM Repositories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21417v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have developed rapidly in recent years, revolutionizing various fields. Despite their widespread success, LLMs heavily rely on external code dependencies from package management systems, creating a complex and interconnected LLM dependency supply chain. Vulnerabilities in dependencies can expose LLMs to security risks. While existing research predominantly focuses on model-level security threats, vulnerabilities within the LLM dependency supply chain have been overlooked. To fill this gap, we conducted an empirical analysis of 52 open-source LLMs, examining their third-party dependencies and associated vulnerabilities. We then explored activities within the LLM repositories to understand how maintainers manage third-party vulnerabilities in practice. Finally, we compared third-party dependency vulnerabilities in the LLM ecosystem to those in the Python ecosystem. Our results show that half of the vulnerabilities in the LLM ecosystem remain undisclosed for more than 56.2 months, significantly longer than those in the Python ecosystem. Additionally, 75.8% of LLMs include vulnerable dependencies in their configuration files. This study advances the understanding of LLM supply chain risks, provides insights for practitioners, and highlights potential directions for improving the security of the LLM supply chain.</p></details> |  |

Such an approach is also used in recent cyber security legislation enacted in the EU. Risks are also inherently related to compliance with the new legislation. Objective: The paper investigates how risks are framed in the EU's five core cyber security legislative acts, whether the framings indicate convergence or divergence between the acts and their risk concepts, and what qualifying words and terms are used when describing the legal notions of risks. Method : The paper's methodology is based on qualitative legal interpretation and taxonomy-building. Results: The five acts have an encompassing coverage of different cyber security risks, including but not limited to risks related to technical, organizational, and human security as well as those not originating from man-made actions. Both technical aspects and assets are used to frame the legal risk notions in many of the legislative acts. A threat-centric viewpoint is also present in one of the acts. Notable gaps are related to acceptable risks, non-probabilistic risks, and residual risks. Conclusion: The EU's new cyber security legislation has significantly extended the risk-based approach to regulations. At the same time, complexity and compliance burden have increased. With this point in mind, the paper concludes with a few practical takeaways about means to deal with compliance and research it.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IST (VSI:RegCompliance in SE)</p></details> |

This paper benchmarks LLMs for PennyLane-based quantum code generation using real-world challenges from the Quantum Hackathon (QHack). We introduce QHackBench, a novel benchmark dataset derived from QHack competitions, and evaluate model performance under vanilla prompting and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Our structured evaluation framework assesses functional correctness, syntactic validity, and execution success across varying challenge difficulties. Results indicate that RAG-enhanced models, supplemented with an augmented PennyLane dataset, approximately generate similar results as the standard prompting, particularly in complex quantum algorithms. Additionally, we introduce a multi-agent evaluation pipeline that iteratively refines incorrect solutions, further enhancing execution success rates. To foster further research, we commit to publicly releasing QHackBench, along with our evaluation framework and experimental results, enabling continued advancements in AI-assisted quantum programming.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at the IEEE International Conference on Quantum Artificial Intelligence (QAI), Naples, Italy, November 2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards Automated Detection of Inline Code Comment Smells](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18956v2)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code comments are important in software development because they directly influence software maintainability and overall quality. Bad practices of code comments lead to code comment smells, negatively impacting software maintenance. Recent research has been conducted on classifying inline code comment smells, yet automatically detecting these still remains a challenge. We aim to automatically detect and classify inline code comment smells through machine learning (ML) models and a large language model (LLM) to determine how accurately each smell type can be detected. We enhanced a previously labeled dataset, where comments are labeled according to a determined taxonomy, by augmenting it with additional code segments and their associated comments. GPT 4, a large language model, was used to classify code comment smells on both the original and augmented datasets to evaluate its performance. In parallel, we trained and tested seven different machine learning algorithms on the augmented dataset to compare their classification performance against GPT 4. The performance of models, particularly Random Forest, which achieved an overall accuracy of 69 percent, along with Gradient Boosting and Logistic Regression, each achieving 66 percent and 65 percent, respectively, establishes a solid baseline for future research in this domain. The Random Forest model outperformed all other ML models, by achieving the highest Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) score of 0.44. The augmented dataset improved the overall classification accuracy of the GPT 4 model predictions from 34 percent to 55 percent. This study contributes to software maintainability by exploring the automatic detection and classification of inline code comment smells. We have made our augmented dataset and code artifacts available online, offering a valuable resource for developing automated comment smell detection tools.</p></details> |  |

To alleviate these challenges, AI simulation uses virtual training environments in which AI agents can be safely and efficiently developed with simulated, synthetic data. Digital twins open new avenues in AI simulation, as these high-fidelity virtual replicas of physical systems are equipped with state-of-the-art simulators and the ability to further interact with the physical system for additional data collection. In this article, we report on our systematic survey of digital twin-enabled AI simulation. By analyzing 22 primary studies, we identify technological trends and derive a reference framework to situate digital twins and AI components. Based on our findings, we derive a reference framework and provide architectural guidelines by mapping it onto the ISO 23247 reference architecture for digital twins. Finally, we identify challenges and research opportunities for prospective researchers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Locus: Agentic Predicate Synthesis for Directed Fuzzing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21302v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Directed fuzzing aims to find program inputs that lead to specified target program states. It has broad applications, such as debugging system crashes, confirming reported bugs, and generating exploits for potential vulnerabilities. This task is inherently challenging because target states are often deeply nested in the program, while the search space manifested by numerous possible program inputs is prohibitively large. Existing approaches rely on branch distances or manually-specified constraints to guide the search; however, the branches alone are often insufficient to precisely characterize progress toward reaching the target states, while the manually specified constraints are often tailored for specific bug types and thus difficult to generalize to diverse target states and programs. We present Locus, a novel framework to improve the efficiency of directed fuzzing. Our key insight is to synthesize predicates to capture fuzzing progress as semantically meaningful intermediate states, serving as milestones towards reaching the target states. When used to instrument the program under fuzzing, they can reject executions unlikely to reach the target states, while providing additional coverage guidance. To automate this task and generalize to diverse programs, Locus features an agentic framework with program analysis tools to synthesize and iteratively refine the candidate predicates, while ensuring the predicates strictly relax the target states to prevent false rejections via symbolic execution. Our evaluation shows that Locus substantially improves the efficiency of eight state-of-the-art fuzzers in discovering real-world vulnerabilities, achieving an average speedup of 41.6x. So far, Locus has found eight previously unpatched bugs, with one already acknowledged with a draft patch.</p></details> |  |

Existing diagnosability supports focus on post-failure analysis of software behavior to identify configuration issues, but none of these approaches look into whether the software clue sufficient failure information for diagnosis. To fill in the blank, we propose the idea of configuration logging to enhance existing logging practices at the source code level. We develop ConfLogger, the first tool that unifies configuration-aware static taint analysis with LLM-based log generation to enhance software configuration diagnosability. Specifically, our method 1) identifies configuration-sensitive code segments by tracing configuration-related data flow in the whole project, and 2) generates diagnostic log statements by analyzing configuration code contexts. Evaluation results on eight popular software systems demonstrate the effectiveness of ConfLogger to enhance configuration diagnosability. Specifically, ConfLogger-enhanced logs successfully aid a log-based misconfiguration diagnosis tool to achieve 100% accuracy on error localization in 30 silent misconfiguration scenarios, with 80% directly resolvable through explicit configuration information exposed. In addition, ConfLogger achieves 74% coverage of existing logging points, outperforming baseline LLM-based loggers by 12% and 30%. It also gains 8.6% higher in precision, 79.3% higher in recall, and 26.2% higher in F1 compared to the state-of-the-art baseline in terms of variable logging while also augmenting diagnostic value. A controlled user study on 22 cases further validated its utility, speeding up diagnostic time by 1.25x and improving troubleshooting accuracy by 251.4%.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, accepted by ICSE '26 (The 48th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering)</p></details> |

Yet, many papers do not meet such requirements. The uniqueness of HPC infrastructure and software, coupled with strict access requirements, may limit opportunities for reproducibility. In the absence of resource access, we believe that regular documented testing, through continuous integration (CI), coupled with complete provenance information, can be used as a substitute. Here, we argue that better HPC-compliant CI solutions will improve reproducibility of applications. We present a survey of reproducibility initiatives and describe the barriers to reproducibility in HPC. To address existing limitations, we present a GitHub Action, CORRECT, that enables secure execution of tests on remote HPC resources. We evaluate CORRECT's usability across three different types of HPC applications, demonstrating the effectiveness of using CORRECT for automating and documenting reproducibility evaluations.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM as an Execution Estimator: Recovering Missing Dependency for Practical Time-travelling Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18721v4)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose RecovSlicing for computing dynamic data dependency in a single run, with only partial instrumentation. We explore the intuition that LLM can potentially infer program dynamics based on a partially recorded trace and relevant code as its context. Given (1) a partially recorded trace of a program $P$ and (2) the slicing criteria consisting of a query step $s$ and a query variable $v$ read by $s$, RecovSlicing computes the runtime definition of $v$ on the trace by estimating the miss-recorded execution of $P$. In this work, we allow the user to specify implicit query variable, for example, the implicit library variable used in list{\ttfamily .}get(i). Technically, built upon non-deterministic LLM, we address the challenges of (1) precise recovery of runtime variable value and structure from the recorded execution and (2) aligning the memory address of recovered variables and the recorded variables for definition analysis. We extensively evaluate RecovSlicing against the state-of-the-art slicers such as Slicer4J, ND-Slicer, LLM Slicer, and re-execution Slicer on a total number of 8300 data-dependencies over 3 slicing benchmarks. The results show that RecovSlicing can significantly outperform the baselines. The accuracy and recall, achieving 80.3%, 91.1%, and 98.3% on the three benchmarks, whereas the best baseline reaches 39.0%, 82.0%, and 59.9% (accuracy), and 53.4%, 79.1%, and 87.1% (recall), respectively. In addition, we integrate RecovSlicing in a dual-slicing based regression bug localizer, significantly improving its performance by locating 16% more regressions.</p></details> |  |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have made strides in code generation, they struggle to achieve high branch coverage due to their limited ability to reason about intricate control flow structures. To address this limitation, we introduce Panta, a technique that emulates the iterative process human developers follow when analyzing code and constructing test cases. Panta integrates static control flow analysis and dynamic code coverage analysis to systematically guide LLMs in identifying uncovered execution paths and generating better test cases. By incorporating an iterative feedback-driven mechanism, our technique continuously refines test generation based on static and dynamic path coverage insights, ensuring more comprehensive and effective testing. Our empirical evaluation, conducted on classes with high cyclomatic complexity from open-source projects, demonstrates that Panta achieves 26% higher line coverage and 23% higher branch coverage compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in 2026 IEEE/ACM 48th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2026)</p></details> |

However, this flexibility often introduces code quality issues, with prior studies showing that approximately 76% of public notebooks are non-executable, raising significant concerns about reusability. We argue that the traditional notion of executability - requiring a notebook to run fully and without error - is overly rigid, misclassifying many notebooks and overestimating their non-executability. This paper investigates pathological executability issues in public notebooks under varying notions and degrees of executability. Even partially improving executability can improve code comprehension and offer a pathway for dynamic analyses. With this insight, we first categorize notebooks into potentially restorable and pathological non-executable notebooks and then measure how removing misconfiguration and superficial execution issues in notebooks can improve their executability (i.e., additional cells executed without error). In a dataset of 42,546 popular public notebooks containing 34,659 non-executable notebooks, only 21.3% are truly pathologically non-executable. For restorable notebooks, LLM-based methods fully restore 5.4% of previously non-executable notebooks. Among the partially restored, the executability of notebooks improves by 42.7% and 28% by installing the correct modules and generating synthetic data. These findings challenge prior assumptions, suggesting that notebooks have higher executability than previously reported, many of which offer valuable partial execution, and that their executability should be evaluated within the interactive notebook paradigm rather than through traditional software executability standards.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables, the 22nd International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR 2025)</p></details> |

We present a lightweight framework that instruction-tuned large language model (LLM) with LoRA adapters and uses candidate-constrained decoding to ensure valid assignments. Tested on EclipseJDT and Mozilla datasets, the model achieves strong shortlist quality (Hit at 10 up to 0.753) despite modest exact Top-1 accuracy. On recent snapshots, accuracy rises sharply, showing the framework's potential for real-world, human-in-the-loop triaging. Our results suggest that instruction-tuned LLMs offer a practical alternative to costly feature engineering and graph-based methods.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |

| **[Characterizing Trust Boundary Vulnerabilities in TEE Containers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20962v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) have emerged as a cornerstone of confidential computing, garnering significant attention from both academia and industry. To enable the secure development, execution, and deployment, of applications on TEE platforms, TEE containers have been introduced as middleware solutions. These containers aim to shield applications from potentially malicious operating systems and orchestration interfaces while maintaining usability and reliability. In this paper, we analyze the isolation strategies employed by existing TEE containers to protect secure applications. To address the challenges in analyzing these interfaces, we designed an automated analyzer to precisely identify and evaluate their isolation boundaries. We observed that some TEE containers fail to achieve their intended goals due to critical design and implementation flaws, such as information leakage, rollback attacks, denial-of-service, and Iago attacks, which pose significant security risks. Drawing from our findings, we share key lessons to guide the development of more secure container solutions and discuss emerging trends in TEE containerization design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning Based Concurrency Bug Detection and Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20911v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concurrency bugs, caused by improper synchronization of shared resources in multi-threaded or distributed systems, are notoriously hard to detect and thus compromise software reliability and security. The existing deep learning methods face three main limitations. First, there is an absence of large and dedicated datasets of diverse concurrency bugs for them. Second, they lack sufficient representation of concurrency semantics. Third, binary classification results fail to provide finer-grained debug information such as precise bug lines. To address these problems, we propose a novel method for effective concurrency bug detection as well as localization. We construct a dedicated concurrency bug dataset to facilitate model training and evaluation. We then integrate a pre-trained model with a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN), by incorporating a new Concurrency-Aware Code Property Graph (CCPG) that concisely and effectively characterizes concurrency semantics. To further facilitate debugging, we employ SubgraphX, a GNN-based interpretability method, which explores the graphs to precisely localize concurrency bugs, mapping them to specific lines of source code. On average, our method demonstrates an improvement of 10\% in accuracy and precision and 26\% in recall compared to state-of-the-art methods across diverse evaluation settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Test Oracles for Flaky Cyber-Physical System Simulators: Approach and Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20902v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulation-based testing of cyber-physical systems (CPS) is costly due to the time-consuming execution of CPS simulators. In addition, CPS simulators may be flaky, leading to inconsistent test outcomes and requiring repeated test re-execution for reliable test verdicts. Automated test oracles that do not require system execution are therefore crucial for reducing testing costs. Ideally, such test oracles should be interpretable to facilitate human understanding of test verdicts, and they must be robust against the potential flakiness of CPS simulators. In this article, we propose assertion-based test oracles for CPS as sets of logical and arithmetic predicates defined over the inputs of the system under test. Given a test input, our assertion-based test oracle determines, without requiring test execution, whether the test passes, fails, or if the oracle is inconclusive in predicting a verdict. We describe two methods for generating assertion-based test oracles: one using genetic programming~(GP) that employs well-known spectrum-based fault localization (SBFL) ranking formulas, namely Ochiai, Tarantula, and Naish, as fitness functions; and the other using decision trees (DT) and decision rules (DR). We evaluate our assertion-based test oracles through case studies in the domains of aerospace, networking and autonomous driving. We show that test oracles generated using GP with Ochiai are significantly more accurate than those obtained using GP with Tarantula and Naish or using DT or DR. Moreover, this accuracy advantage remains even when accounting for the flakiness of the system under test. We further show that the assertion-based test oracles generated by GP with Ochiai are robust against flakiness with only 4% average variation in their accuracy results across four different network and autonomous driving systems with flaky behaviours.</p></details> |  |

Given the challenges in writing comprehensive unit tests, LLMs have been employed to automate test generation, yet methods for training LLMs to produce high-quality tests remain underexplored. In this work, we propose UTRL, a novel reinforcement learning framework that trains an LLM to generate high-quality unit tests given a programming instruction. Our key idea is to iteratively train two LLMs, the unit test generator and the code generator, in an adversarial manner via reinforcement learning. The unit test generator is trained to maximize a discrimination reward, which reflects its ability to produce tests that expose faults in the code generator's solutions, and the code generator is trained to maximize a code reward, which reflects its ability to produce solutions that pass the unit tests generated by the test generator. In our experiments, we demonstrate that unit tests generated by Qwen3-4B trained via UTRL show higher quality compared to unit tests generated by the same model trained via supervised fine-tuning on human-written ground-truth unit tests, yielding code evaluations that more closely align with those induced by the ground-truth tests. Moreover, Qwen3-4B trained with UTRL outperforms frontier models such as GPT-4.1 in generating high-quality unit tests, highlighting the effectiveness of UTRL in training LLMs for this task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at: https://github.com/dgjun32/UTRL</p></details> |

Architectural perspectives-an architectural knowledge artifact composed of concerns, activities, tactics, pitfalls, and checklists-offer a promising approach to tackle such emerging quality properties across architectural views and are also independent of architecture frameworks and industry contexts. In this paper, we present a sustainability perspective vision, i.e., a revised notion of architectural perspective meant to be filled with its own elements to target sustainability concerns. We formulate our sustainability perspective vision through evidence from applying snowballing to seminal literature and from conducting a focus group with experts in the field. Our findings confirm the relevance of the different perspective elements in practice and highlight implications for shaping a sustainability perspective that meets industrial needs.</p></details> |  |

While these tools streamline development, they also introduce subtle risks to the software supply chain. In this paper, we present Maven-Hijack, a novel attack that exploits the order in which Maven packages dependencies and the way the Java Virtual Machine resolves classes at runtime. By injecting a malicious class with the same fully qualified name as a legitimate one into a dependency that is packaged earlier, an attacker can silently override core application behavior without modifying the main codebase or library names. We demonstrate the real-world feasibility of this attack by compromising the Corona-Warn-App, a widely used open-source COVID-19 contact tracing system, and gaining control over its database connection logic. We evaluate three mitigation strategies, such as sealed JARs, Java Modules, and the Maven Enforcer plugin. Our results show that, while Java Modules offer strong protection, the Maven Enforcer plugin with duplicate class detection provides the most practical and effective defense for current Java projects. These findings highlight the urgent need for improved safeguards in Java's build and dependency management processes to prevent stealthy supply chain attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, added a mitigation chapter</p></details> |

However, the ability to explain why predictors make certain predictions remains limited. Explainable SDP has emerged as a promising solution by using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods to clarify the decision-making processes of predictors. Despite this progress, there is still significant potential to enhance the reliability of existing approaches. To address this limitation, we treat defect prediction and the corresponding interpretation as two distinct but closely related tasks and propose a joint learning framework that allows for the simultaneous training of the predictor and its interpreter. The novelty of our approach lies in two main aspects: 1. We design feedback loops that convey the decision-making logic from the predictor to the interpreter. This ensures a high level of conciseness in decision logic and feature engineering for both the predictor and the interpreter, enabling the interpreter to achieve reliable local and global interpretability. 2. We incorporate the interpretation results as a penalty term in the loss function of the joint-learning framework. This not only improves the accuracy of the predictor but also imposes a stronger constraint on the reliability of the interpreter. We validated our proposed method against several existing explainable SDPs across multiple datasets. The results demonstrate its effectiveness in both interpretation and defect prediction. The source code for the proposed method is available at: https://github.com/BugPredictor/software-defect-prediction.git</p></details> |  |

This creates challenges for engineers who must develop compliance artifacts such as requirements and acceptance criteria. Manual creation is labor-intensive, error-prone, and requires domain expertise. Advances in Generative AI (GenAI), especially Large Language Models (LLMs), offer a way to automate deriving such artifacts. Objective: We present the first systematic human-subject study of LLMs' ability to derive behavioral specifications from legal texts using a quasi-experimental design. These specifications translate legal requirements into a developer-friendly form. Methods: Ten participants evaluated specifications generated from food-safety regulations by Claude and Llama. Using Gherkin, a structured BDD language, 60 specifications were produced. Each participant assessed 12 across five criteria: Relevance, Clarity, Completeness, Singularity, and Time Savings. Each specification was reviewed by two participants, yielding 120 assessments. Results: For Relevance, 75% of ratings were highest and 20% second-highest. Clarity reached 90% highest. Completeness: 75% highest, 19% second. Singularity: 82% highest, 12% second. Time Savings: 68% highest, 24% second. No lowest ratings occurred. Mann-Whitney U tests showed no significant differences across participants or models. Llama slightly outperformed Claude in Clarity, Completeness, and Time Savings, while Claude was stronger in Singularity. Feedback noted hallucinations and omissions but confirmed the utility of the specifications. Conclusion: LLMs can generate high-quality Gherkin specifications from legal texts, reducing manual effort and providing structured artifacts useful for implementation, assurance, and test generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Testing for LLM Applications: Characteristics, Challenges, and a Lightweight Interaction Protocol](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20737v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Applications of Large Language Models~(LLMs) have evolved from simple text generators into complex software systems that integrate retrieval augmentation, tool invocation, and multi-turn interactions. Their inherent non-determinism, dynamism, and context dependence pose fundamental challenges for quality assurance. This paper decomposes LLM applications into a three-layer architecture: \textbf{\textit{System Shell Layer}}, \textbf{\textit{Prompt Orchestration Layer}}, and \textbf{\textit{LLM Inference Core}}. We then assess the applicability of traditional software testing methods in each layer: directly applicable at the shell layer, requiring semantic reinterpretation at the orchestration layer, and necessitating paradigm shifts at the inference core. A comparative analysis of Testing AI methods from the software engineering community and safety analysis techniques from the AI community reveals structural disconnects in testing unit abstraction, evaluation metrics, and lifecycle management. We identify four fundamental differences that underlie 6 core challenges. To address these, we propose four types of collaborative strategies (\emph{Retain}, \emph{Translate}, \emph{Integrate}, and \emph{Runtime}) and explore a closed-loop, trustworthy quality assurance framework that combines pre-deployment validation with runtime monitoring. Based on these strategies, we offer practical guidance and a protocol proposal to support the standardization and tooling of LLM application testing. We propose a protocol \textbf{\textit{Agent Interaction Communication Language}} (AICL) that is used to communicate between AI agents. AICL has the test-oriented features and is easily integrated in the current agent framework.</p></details> |  |

Data types such as bioimages, experimental records, and spectral information are often maintained in separate repositories, each following different management standards. However, linking these data sources across the research lifecycle is essential to align with the FAIR principles of data management: Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability. Despite this need, there is a notable lack of tools capable of effectively integrating and linking data from heterogeneous sources. To address this gap, we present LEO (Linking Electronic Lab Notebooks with OMERO), a web-based platform designed to create and manage links between distributed data systems. LEO was initially developed to link objects between Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELNs) and OMERO, but its functionality has since been extended through a plugin-based architecture, allowing the integration of additional data sources. This extensibility makes LEO a scalable and flexible solution for a wide range of microscopy research workflows.</p></details> |  |

The workshop brought together over 30 interdisciplinary academic researchers and industry practitioners to tackle the concrete challenges and emerging opportunities at the intersection of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and agile software development. Through structured, interactive breakout sessions, participants identified shared pain points like tool fragmentation, governance, data quality, and critical skills gaps in AI literacy and prompt engineering. These issues were further analyzed, revealing underlying causes and cross-cutting concerns. The workshop concluded by collaboratively co-creating a multi-thematic research roadmap, articulating both short-term, implementable actions and visionary, long-term research directions. This cohesive agenda aims to guide future investigation and drive the responsible, human-centered integration of GenAI into agile practices.</p></details> |  |

However, current LLM API-using methods struggle with complex API coupling commonly encountered in academic queries. To address this, we introduce SoAy, a solution-based LLM API-using methodology for academic information seeking. It uses code with a solution as the reasoning method, where a solution is a pre-constructed API calling sequence. The addition of the solution reduces the difficulty for the model to understand the complex relationships between APIs. Code improves the efficiency of reasoning. To evaluate SoAy, we introduce SoAyBench, an evaluation benchmark accompanied by SoAyEval, built upon a cloned environment of APIs from AMiner. Experimental results demonstrate a 34.58-75.99\% performance improvement compared to state-of-the-art LLM API-based baselines. All datasets, codes, tuned models, and deployed online services are publicly accessible at https://github.com/RUCKBReasoning/SoAy.</p></details> | <details><summary>KDD 2...</summary><p>KDD 2025; 22 pages, 13 figures</p></details> |

Countries such as Bhutan have already implemented an SSI infrastructure to manage the identity of their citizens. The EU, thanks to the revised eIDAS regulation, is opening the door for SSI vendors to develop SSI systems for the planned EU digital identity wallet. These developments, which fall within the sovereign domain, raise questions about individual privacy. The design of SSI systems is complex, often characterized by a large number of components and architectural choices because the current SSI communities differ on how to create identifiers, how to build and present credentials, and even how to design a user wallet. SSI stacks developed by different organizations provide different privacy features for different privacy needs. This paper performs a systematic mapping and review of SSI components and technologies into a novel four-layer privacy framework to address the design complexity of SSI systems. Based on this review, we provide an accompanying Design Assistance Dashboard (DAD). The DAD shows the interdependencies between SSI components in different layers, and maps these components to different privacy requirements and considerations, even providing a simple privacy class for each component.</p></details> |  |

At the same time, their security has increasingly been acknowledged as a problem. To this end, the paper examines the previously overlooked longitudinal aspects of software ecosystem security, focusing on malware uploaded to six popular programming language ecosystems. The dataset examined is based on the new Open Source Vulnerabilities (OSV) database. According to the results, records about detected malware uploads in the database have recently surpassed those addressing vulnerabilities in packages distributed in the ecosystems. In the early 2025 even up to 80% of all entries in the OSV have been about malware. Regarding time series analysis of malware frequencies and their shares to all database entries, good predictions are available already by relatively simple autoregressive models using the numbers of ecosystems, security advisories, and media and other articles as predictors. With these results and the accompanying discussion, the paper improves and advances the understanding of the thus far overlooked longitudinal aspects of ecosystems and malware.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security (ARES 2025), Ghent, Springer, pp. 269-285.

| **[Adaptive Root Cause Localization for Microservice Systems with Multi-Agent Recursion-of-Thought](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20370v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As contemporary microservice systems become increasingly popular and complex-often comprising hundreds or even thousands of fine-grained, interdependent subsystems-they are facing more frequent failures. Ensuring system reliability thus demands accurate root cause localization. While traces and metrics have proven to be effective data sources for this task, existing methods either heavily rely on pre-defined schemas, which struggle to adapt to evolving operational contexts, or lack interpretability in their reasoning process, thereby leaving Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) confused. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on how SREs localize the root cause of failures, drawing insights from multiple professional SREs across different organizations. Our investigation reveals that human root cause analysis exhibits three key characteristics: recursiveness, multi-dimensional expansion, and cross-modal reasoning. Motivated by these findings, we introduce RCLAgent, an adaptive root cause localization method for microservice systems that leverages a multi-agent recursion-of-thought framework. RCLAgent employs a novel recursion-of-thought strategy to guide the LLM's reasoning process, effectively integrating data from multiple agents and tool-assisted analysis to accurately pinpoint the root cause. Experimental evaluations on various public datasets demonstrate that RCLAgent achieves superior performance by localizing the root cause using only a single request-outperforming state-of-the-art methods that depend on aggregating multiple requests. These results underscore the effectiveness of RCLAgent in enhancing the efficiency and precision of root cause localization in complex microservice environments.</p></details> |  |

The focus is on quantum and hybrid quantum-classical software systems, where model-driven approaches can help reduce the costs and mitigate the risks associated with the heterogeneous platform landscape and lack of developers' skills. We validate one of the proposed ideas regarding generating code out of UML model instances of software systems. This Python code uses a well-established library, called Qiskit, to execute on gate-based or circuit-based quantum computers. The RAG pipeline that we deploy incorporates sample Qiskit code from public GitHub repositories. Experimental results show that well-engineered prompts can improve CodeBLEU scores by up to a factor of four, yielding more accurate and consistent quantum code. However, the proposed research direction can go beyond this through further investigation in the future by conducting experiments to address our other research questions and ideas proposed here, such as deploying software system model instances as the source of information in the RAG pipelines, or deploying LLMs for code-to-code transformations, for instance, for transpilation use cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted to the New Ideas and Emerging Results (NIER) track of the ACM/IEEE 28th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems (MODELS)</p></details> |
| **[Boosting Skeleton-Driven SMT Solver Fuzzing by Leveraging LLM to Produce Formula Generators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20340v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers are foundational to modern systems and programming languages research, providing the foundation for tasks like symbolic execution and automated verification. Because these solvers sit on the critical path, their correctness is essential, and high-quality test formulas are key to uncovering bugs. However, while prior testing techniques performed well on earlier solver versions, they struggle to keep pace with rapidly evolving features. Recent approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in exploring advanced solver capabilities, but two obstacles remain: nearly half of the generated formulas are syntactically invalid, and iterative interactions with the LLMs introduce substantial computational overhead. In this study, we present Chimera, a novel LLM-assisted fuzzing framework that addresses both issues by shifting from direct formula generation to the synthesis of reusable term (i.e., logical expression) generators. Particularly, Chimera uses LLMs to (1) automatically extract context-free grammars (CFGs) for SMT theories, including solver-specific extensions, from documentation, and (2) synthesize composable Boolean term generators that adhere to these grammars. During fuzzing, Chimera populates structural skeletons derived from existing formulas with the terms iteratively produced by the LLM-synthesized generators. This design ensures syntactic validity while promoting semantic diversity. Notably, Chimera requires only one-time LLM interaction investment, dramatically reducing runtime cost. We evaluated Chimera on two leading SMT solvers: Z3 and cvc5. Our experiments show that Chimera has identified 43 confirmed bugs, 40 of which have already been fixed by developers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Automated Loop Invariant Generation for Complex Programs with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10483v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated program verification has always been an important component of building trustworthy software. While the analysis of real-world programs remains a theoretical challenge, the automation of loop invariant analysis has effectively resolved the problem. However, real-world programs that often mix complex data structures and control flows pose challenges to traditional loop invariant generation tools. To enhance the applicability of invariant generation techniques, we proposed ACInv, an Automated Complex program loop Invariant generation tool, which combines static analysis with Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate the proper loop invariants. We utilize static analysis to extract the necessary information for each loop and embed it into prompts for the LLM to generate invariants for each loop. Subsequently, we employ an LLM-based evaluator to assess the generated invariants, refining them by either strengthening, weakening, or rejecting them based on their correctness, ultimately obtaining enhanced invariants. We conducted experiments on ACInv, which showed that ACInv outperformed previous tools on data sets with data structures, and maintained similar performance to the state-of-the-art tool AutoSpec on numerical programs without data structures. For the total data set, ACInv can solve 21% more examples than AutoSpec and can generate reference data structure templates.</p></details> | 26 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Detecting Metadata-Related Bugs in Enterprise Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14463v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When building enterprise applications (EAs) on Java frameworks (e.g., Spring), developers often configure application components via metadata (i.e., Java annotations and XML files). It is challenging for developers to correctly use metadata, because the usage rules can be complex and existing tools provide limited assistance. When developers misuse metadata, EAs become misconfigured, which defects can trigger erroneous runtime behaviors or introduce security vulnerabilities. To help developers correctly use metadata, this paper presents (1) RSL -- a domain-specific language that domain experts can adopt to prescribe metadata checking rules, and (2) MeCheck -- a tool that takes in RSL rules and EAs to check for rule violations. With RSL, domain experts (e.g., developers of a Java framework) can specify metadata checking rules by defining content consistency among XML files, annotations, and Java code. Given such RSL rules and a program to scan, MeCheck interprets rules as cross-file static analyzers, which analyzers scan Java and/or XML files to gather information and look for consistency violations. For evaluation, we studied the Spring and JUnit documentation to manually define 15 rules, and created 2 datasets with 115 open-source EAs. The first dataset includes 45 EAs, and the ground truth of 45 manually injected bugs. The second dataset includes multiple versions of 70 EAs. We observed that MeCheck identified bugs in the first dataset with 100% precision, 96% recall, and 98% F-score. It reported 156 bugs in the second dataset, 53 of which bugs were already fixed by developers. Our evaluation shows that MeCheck helps ensure the correct usage of metadata.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hallucination to Consensus: Multi-Agent LLMs for End-to-End Test Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02943v5)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unit testing plays a critical role in ensuring software correctness. However, writing unit tests manually is labor-intensive, especially for strongly typed languages like Java, motivating the need for automated approaches. Traditional methods primarily rely on search-based or randomized algorithms to achieve high code coverage and produce regression oracles, which are derived from the program's current behavior rather than its intended functionality. Recent advances in LLMs have enabled oracle generation from natural language descriptions, aligning better with user requirements. However, existing LLM-based methods often require fine-tuning or rely on external tools such as EvoSuite for test prefix generation, making them costly or cumbersome to apply in practice. In this work, we propose CANDOR, a novel prompt engineering-based LLM framework for automated unit test generation in Java. CANDOR orchestrates multiple specialized LLM agents to collaboratively generate complete tests. To mitigate the notorious hallucinations in LLMs and improve oracle correctness, we introduce a novel strategy that engages multiple reasoning LLMs in a panel discussion and generates accurate oracles based on consensus. Additionally, to reduce the verbosity of reasoning LLMs' outputs, we propose a novel dual-LLM pipeline to produce concise and structured oracle evaluations. Our experiments show that CANDOR is comparable with EvoSuite in generating tests with high code coverage and clearly superior in terms of mutation score. Moreover, our prompt engineering-based approach CANDOR significantly outperforms the SOTA fine-tuning-based oracle generator TOGLL by at least 21.1 percentage points in oracle correctness on both correct and faulty source code. Further ablation studies confirm the critical contributions of key agents in generating high-quality tests.</p></details> |  |

Software today is often "illegible" - lacking a direct correspondence between code and observed behavior - and insufficiently modular, leading to a failure of three key requirements of robust coding: incrementality (the ability to deliver small increments by making localized changes), integrity (avoiding breaking prior increments) and transparency (making clear what has changed at build time, and what actions have happened at runtime). A new structural pattern offers improved legibility and modularity. Its elements are concepts and synchronizations: fully independent services and event-based rules that mediate between them. A domain-specific language for synchronizations allows behavioral features to be expressed in a granular and declarative way (and thus readily generated by an LLM). A case study of the RealWorld benchmark is used to illustrate and evaluate the approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages.

With the increasing prevalence of cyberattacks targeting IoT devices, there is a parallel rise in the development of malware across various Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs). It is thus important to extend malware detection capacity to multiple ISAs. However, training a deep learning-based malware detection model usually requires a large number of labeled malware samples. The process of collecting and labeling sufficient malware samples to build datasets for each ISA is labor-intensive and time-consuming. To reduce the burden of data collection, we propose to leverage the ideas of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) and Normalizing Flows (NFs) for malware detection. Specifically, when dealing with malware in a certain ISA, we translate it to an ISA with sufficient malware samples (like X86-64). This allows us to apply a model trained on one ISA to analyze malware from another ISA. Our approach reduces the data collection effort by enabling malware detection across multiple ISAs using a model trained on a single ISA.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted to EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |

SmartIntentNN is a deep learning model specifically designed to identify unsafe intents in smart contracts. This model integrates the Universal Sentence Encoder, a K-means clustering-based intent highlighting mechanism, and a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network for multi-label classification, achieving an F1 of 0.8633 in distinguishing ten different intent categories. In this study, we present an upgraded version of this model, SmartIntentNN2 (Smart Contract Intent Neural Network V2). A significant enhancement in V2 is the incorporation of a BERT-based pre-trained language model, which has been trained on a dataset of 16,000 real smart contracts using a Masked Language Modeling objective. SmartIntentNN2 retains the BiLSTM-based multi-label classification network. With an improved F1 of 0.927, V2 demonstrates enhanced performance compared to its predecessor, establishing itself as the state-of-the-art model for smart contract intent detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, conference</p></details> |

However, before large-scale deployment on public roads, extensive testing is necessary to validate their functionality and safety under diverse driving conditions. Therefore, different testing approaches are required, and achieving effective and efficient testing of ADS remains an open challenge. Recently, generative AI has emerged as a powerful tool across many domains, and it is increasingly being applied to ADS testing due to its ability to interpret context, reason about complex tasks, and generate diverse outputs. To gain a deeper understanding of its role in ADS testing, we systematically analyzed 91 relevant studies and synthesized their findings into six major application categories, primarily centered on scenario-based testing of ADS. We also reviewed their effectiveness and compiled a wide range of datasets, simulators, ADS, metrics, and benchmarks used for evaluation, while identifying 27 limitations. This survey provides an overview and practical insights into the use of generative AI for testing ADS, highlights existing challenges, and outlines directions for future research in this rapidly evolving field.</p></details> | <details><summary>67 pa...</summary><p>67 pages, 6 figures, 29 tables</p></details> |

Prior work has developed sophisticated algorithms to search for concurrency bugs, such as partial order sampling (POS); however, fundamental limitations with existing platforms for concurrency control hinder effective testing of real-world software. We observe that the design space for concurrency control on managed code involves complex trade-offs between expressibility, applicability, and maintainability on the one hand, and bug-finding efficiency on the other hand. This paper presents Fray, a platform for performing push-button concurrency testing of data-race-free JVM programs. The key insight behind Fray is that effective controlled concurrency testing requires orchestrating thread interleavings without replacing existing concurrency primitives, while encoding their semantics for faithfully expressing the set of all possible program behaviors. Fray incorporates a novel concurrency control mechanism called shadow locking, designed to make controlled concurrency testing practical and efficient for JVM programs. In an empirical evaluation on 53 benchmark programs with known bugs (SCTBench and JaConTeBe), Fray with random search finds 70% more bugs than JPF and 77% more bugs than RR's chaos mode. We also demonstrate Fray's push-button applicability on 2,655 tests from Apache Kafka, Lucene, and Google Guava. In these mature projects, Fray successfully discovered 18 real-world concurrency bugs that can cause 363 tests to fail reproducibly.</p></details> |  |

Earlier opportunistic software reuse practices and organic software development methods are rapidly being replaced by "AI Native" approaches in which developers place their trust on code that has been generated by artificial intelligence. This is leading to a new form of software reuse that is conceptually not all that different from cargo cult development. In this paper we discuss the implications of AI-assisted generative software reuse, bring forth relevant questions, and define a research agenda for tackling the central issues associated with this emerging approach.</p></details> | 21 pages |

However, current benchmarks primarily emphasize functional relevance while neglecting critical dimensions of software quality. Motivated by this gap, we introduce CoQuIR, the first large-scale, multilingual benchmark specifically designed to evaluate quality-aware code retrieval across four key dimensions: correctness, efficiency, security, and maintainability. CoQuIR provides fine-grained quality annotations for 42,725 queries and 134,907 code snippets in 11 programming languages, and is accompanied by two quality-centric evaluation metrics: Pairwise Preference Accuracy and Margin-based Ranking Score. Using CoQuIR, we benchmark 23 retrieval models, covering both open-source and proprietary systems, and find that even top-performing models frequently fail to distinguish buggy or insecure code from their more robust counterparts. Furthermore, we conduct preliminary investigations into training methods that explicitly encourage retrievers to recognize code quality. Using synthetic datasets, we demonstrate promising improvements in quality-aware metrics across various models, without sacrificing semantic relevance. Downstream code generation experiments further validate the effectiveness of our approach. Overall, our work highlights the importance of integrating quality signals into code retrieval systems, laying the groundwork for more trustworthy and robust software development tools.</p></details> |  |

Recently, CMSs have evolved, becoming \emph{headless}. Content served by a \emph{headless CMS} aims to be consumed by other applications and services through REST APIs rather than by human users through a web browser. This evolution has enabled CMSs to become a notorious source of content to be used in a variety of contexts beyond pure web navigation. As such, CMS have become an important component of many information systems. Unfortunately, we still lack the tools to properly discover and manage the information stored in a CMS, often highly customized to the needs of a specific domain. Currently, this is mostly a time-consuming and error-prone manual process. In this paper, we propose a model-based framework to facilitate the integration of headless CMSs in software development processes. Our framework is able to discover and explicitly represent the information schema behind the CMS. This facilitates designing the interaction between the CMS model and other components consuming that information. These interactions are then generated as part of a middleware library that offers platform-agnostic access to the CMS to all the client applications. The complete framework is open-source and available online.</p></details> |  |

This study investigates the feasibility of leveraging large language models (LLMs) to assist in translating PL/SQL code into Java for the modernised "VTF3" system. By leveraging a dataset comprising 10 PL/SQL-to-Java code pairs and 15 Java classes, which collectively established a domain model for the translated files, multiple LLMs were evaluated. Furthermore, we propose a customized prompting strategy that integrates chain-of-guidance reasoning with $n$-shot prompting. Our findings indicate that this methodology effectively guides LLMs in generating syntactically accurate translations while also achieving functional correctness. However, the findings are limited by the small sample size of available code files and the restricted access to test cases used for validating the correctness of the generated code. Nevertheless, these findings lay the groundwork for scalable, automated solutions in modernising large legacy systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[SynthCoder: A Synthetical Strategy to Tune LLMs for Code Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15495v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code completion is a prominent application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software engineering. Due to the near real-time response requirements of this task, base models with small to medium-sized parameters are typically employed, supplemented by various optimization and post-training techniques. However, these optimization methods often have trade-offs, leading to a seesaw effect where performance improvements on certain datasets or metrics are accompanied by degradations on others -- sometimes even falling below the baseline model's performance. This paper proposes SynthCoder, a model that integrates leading industry practices to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) code completion task. In specific, we first construct a diverse dataset by combining Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) node extraction with heuristics that simulate developer behavior. Then we enrich our training corpus with cross-file contextual information using the BM25 algorithm and call graphs, enhancing the model's ability to perform code completion in both file-level and repository-level scenarios. As the last step, we employ a two-stage training process using the Seed-Coder-8B-Base as the base model. First, we fine-tune the model using Curriculum Learning technology. Following this, we perform alignment using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with preference pairs generated through Rejection Sampling. Experimental results demonstrate that our final model excels on mainstream repository-level code completion benchmarks, including aiXcoder, ExecRepoBench, CrossCodeEval, and CoLT. Furthermore, our carefully curated training set effectively mitigates the model's tendency to just repeat existing code, a common issue existing in various code completion models.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Influence of Code Comments on the Perceived Helpfulness of Stack Overflow Posts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19610v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Question-and-answer platforms such as Stack Overflow have become an important way for software developers to share and retrieve knowledge. However, reusing poorly understood code can lead to serious problems, such as bugs or security vulnerabilities. To better understand how code comments affect the perceived helpfulness of Stack Overflow answers, we conducted an online experiment simulating a Stack Overflow environment (n=91). The results indicate that both block and inline comments are perceived as significantly more helpful than uncommented source code. Moreover, novices rated code snippets with block comments as more helpful than those with inline comments. Interestingly, other surface features, such as the position of an answer and its answer score, were considered less important. The content of Stack Overflow has been a major source for training large language models. AI-based coding assistants such as GitHub Copilot, which are based on these models, might change the way Stack Overflow is used. However, our findings have implications beyond this specific platform. First, they may help to improve the relevance of community-driven platforms such as Stack Overflow, which provide human advice and explanations of code solutions, complementing AI-based support for software developers. Second, since chat-based AI tools can be prompted to generate code in different ways, knowing which properties influence perceived helpfulness might lead to targeted prompting strategies to generate more readable code snippets.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables, to appear in the Empirical Software Engineering journal</p></details> |
| **[Functional Consistency of LLM Code Embeddings: A Self-Evolving Data Synthesis Framework for Benchmarking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19558v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Embedding models have demonstrated strong performance in tasks like clustering, retrieval, and feature extraction while offering computational advantages over generative models and cross-encoders. Benchmarks such as MTEB have shown that text embeddings from large language models (LLMs) capture rich semantic information, but their ability to reflect code-level functional semantics remains unclear. Existing studies largely focus on code clone detection, which emphasizes syntactic similarity and overlooks functional understanding. In this paper, we focus on the functional consistency of LLM code embeddings, which determines if two code snippets perform the same function regardless of syntactic differences. We propose a novel data synthesis framework called Functionality-Oriented Code Self-Evolution to construct diverse and challenging benchmarks. Specifically, we define code examples across four semantic and syntactic categories and find that existing datasets predominantly capture syntactic properties. Our framework generates four unique variations from a single code instance, providing a broader spectrum of code examples that better reflect functional differences. Extensive experiments on three downstream tasks-code clone detection, code functional consistency identification, and code retrieval-demonstrate that embedding models significantly improve their performance when trained on our evolved datasets. These results highlight the effectiveness and generalization of our data synthesis framework, advancing the functional understanding of code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Pre-trained Language Models for Vulnerability Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16887v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of pre-trained language models (PLMs) has demonstrated promising results for various code-related tasks. However, their effectiveness in detecting real-world vulnerabilities remains a critical challenge. % for the security community. While existing empirical studies evaluate PLMs for vulnerability detection (VD), their inadequate consideration in data preparation, evaluation setups, and experimental settings undermines the accuracy and comprehensiveness of evaluations. This paper introduces RevisitVD, an extensive evaluation of 17 PLMs spanning smaller code-specific PLMs and large-scale PLMs using newly constructed datasets. Specifically, we compare the performance of PLMs under both fine-tuning and prompt engineering, assess their effectiveness and generalizability across various training and testing settings, and analyze their robustness against code normalization, abstraction, and semantic-preserving transformations. Our findings reveal that, for VD tasks, PLMs incorporating pre-training tasks designed to capture the syntactic and semantic patterns of code outperform both general-purpose PLMs and those solely pre-trained or fine-tuned on large code corpora. However, these models face notable challenges in real-world scenarios, such as difficulties in detecting vulnerabilities with complex dependencies, handling perturbations introduced by code normalization and abstraction, and identifying semantic-preserving vulnerable code transformations. Also, the truncation caused by the limited context windows of PLMs can lead to a non-negligible amount of labeling errors. This study underscores the importance of thorough evaluations of model performance in practical scenarios and outlines future directions to help enhance the effectiveness of PLMs for realistic VD applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stack Trace-Based Crash Deduplication with Transformer Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19449v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated crash reporting systems generate large volumes of duplicate reports, overwhelming issue-tracking systems and increasing developer workload. Traditional stack trace-based deduplication methods, relying on string similarity, rule-based heuristics, or deep learning (DL) models, often fail to capture the contextual and structural relationships within stack traces. We propose dedupT, a transformer-based approach that models stack traces holistically rather than as isolated frames. dedupT first adapts a pretrained language model (PLM) to stack traces, then uses its embeddings to train a fully-connected network (FCN) to rank duplicate crashes effectively. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that dedupT outperforms existing DL and traditional methods (e.g., sequence alignment and information retrieval techniques) in both duplicate ranking and unique crash detection, significantly reducing manual triage effort. On four public datasets, dedupT improves Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) often by over 15% compared to the best DL baseline and up to 9% over traditional methods while achieving higher Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve (ROC-AUC) in detecting unique crash reports. Our work advances the integration of modern natural language processing (NLP) techniques into software engineering, providing an effective solution for stack trace-based crash deduplication.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is currently under review at IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering.

While prior research has examined the quality of AI-generated code, little is known about how developers actually use these suggestions in real-world collaboration. We analyze 338 pull requests from 255 GitHub repositories containing self-admitted ChatGPT usage, including 645 AI-generated snippets and 3,486 developer-authored patches. We introduce PatchTrack, a tool that classifies whether ChatGPT patches were applied, not applied, or not suggested, enabling fine-grained analysis of AI-assisted decisions. Full adoption of ChatGPT code is rare: the median integration rate was 25%. A qualitative analysis of 89 pull requests with integrated patches revealed recurring patterns of structural integration, selective extraction, and iterative refinement, showing that developers typically treat ChatGPT's output as a starting point rather than a final implementation. Even when code was not directly adopted, ChatGPT influenced workflows through conceptual guidance, documentation, and debugging strategies. Integration decisions were shaped by scope, architectural fit, contributor role, and review norms. This study offers empirical insight into how generative AI is used in collaborative software development, showing that its impact extends beyond patch generation to broader decision-making. Our findings inform the design of AI-assisted tools, clarify patch adoption behavior, and support more transparent and effective use of LLMs in practice.</p></details> | 53 pages, 8 figures |

There are significant challenges to the IoT's growth and development, mainly due to the centralized nature and large-scale IoT networks. The emphasis on the decentralization of IoT's architecture can overcome challenges to IoT's capabilities. A promising decentralized platform for IoT is blockchain. Owing to IoT devices' limited resources, traditional consensus algorithms such as PoW and PoS in the blockchain are computationally expensive. Therefore, the PoA consensus algorithm is proposed in the blockchain consensus network for IoT. The PoA selects the validator as Turn-based selection (TBS) that needs optimization and faces system reliability, energy consumption, latency, and low scalability. We propose an efficient, lightweight blockchain for decentralizing IoT architecture by using virtualization and clustering to increase productivity and scalability to address these issues. We also introduce a novel PoA based on the Weight-Based-Selection (WBS) method for validators to validate transactions and add them to the blockchain. By simulation, we evaluated the performance of our proposed WBS method as opposed to TBS. The results show reduced energy consumption, and response time, and increased throughput.</p></details> |  |

However, a comprehensive investigation into VR accessibility for users with disabilities is still lacking. To fill this gap, this study analyzes user reviews from the Meta and Steam stores of VR apps, focusing on the reported issues affecting users with disabilities. We applied selection criteria to 1,367,419 reviews from the top 40, the 20 most popular, and the 40 lowest-rated VR applications on both platforms. In total, 1,076 (0.078%) VR accessibility reviews referenced various disabilities across 100 VR applications. These applications were categorized into Action, Sports, Social, Puzzle, Horror, and Simulation, with Action receiving the highest number of accessibility related-reviews. We identified 16 different types of disabilities across six categories. Furthermore, we examined the causes of accessibility issues as reported by users with disabilities. Overall, VR accessibility reviews were predominantly under-supported.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Slice-Based Change Impact Analysis for Regression Test Case Prioritization of Object-Oriented Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19056v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test case prioritization focuses on finding a suitable order of execution of the test cases in a test suite to meet some performance goals like detecting faults early. It is likely that some test cases execute the program parts that are more prone to errors and will detect more errors if executed early during the testing process. Finding an optimal order of execution for the selected regression test cases saves time and cost of retesting. This paper presents a static approach to prioritizing the test cases by computing the affected component coupling (ACC) of the affected parts of object-oriented programs. We construct a graph named affected slice graph (ASG) to represent these affected program parts.We determine the fault-proneness of the nodes of ASG by computing their respective ACC values. We assign higher priority to those test cases that cover the nodes with higher ACC values. Our analysis with mutation faults shows that the test cases executing the fault-prone program parts have a higher chance to reveal faults earlier than other test cases in the test suite. The result obtained from seven case studies justifies that our approach is feasible and gives acceptable performance in comparison to some existing techniques.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce GitTaskBench, a benchmark designed to systematically assess this capability via 54 realistic tasks across 7 modalities and 7 domains. Each task pairs a relevant repository with an automated, human-curated evaluation harness specifying practical success criteria. Beyond measuring execution and task success, we also propose the alpha-value metric to quantify the economic benefit of agent performance, which integrates task success rates, token cost, and average developer salaries. Experiments across three state-of-the-art agent frameworks with multiple advanced LLMs show that leveraging code repositories for complex task solving remains challenging: even the best-performing system, OpenHands+Claude 3.7, solves only 48.15% of tasks. Error analysis attributes over half of failures to seemingly mundane yet critical steps like environment setup and dependency resolution, highlighting the need for more robust workflow management and increased timeout preparedness. By releasing GitTaskBench, we aim to drive progress and attention toward repository-aware code reasoning, execution, and deployment -- moving agents closer to solving complex, end-to-end real-world tasks. The benchmark and code are open-sourced at https://github.com/QuantaAlpha/GitTaskBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Highl...</summary><p>Highly practical, Well-motivated, Actionable</p></details> |
| **[Interleaving Large Language Models for Compiler Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18955v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Testing compilers with AI models, especially large language models (LLMs), has shown great promise. However, current approaches struggle with two key problems: The generated programs for testing compilers are often too simple, and extensive testing with the LLMs is computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose a novel compiler testing framework that decouples the testing process into two distinct phases: an offline phase and an online phase. In the offline phase, we use LLMs to generate a collection of small but feature-rich code pieces. In the online phase, we reuse these code pieces by strategically combining them to build high-quality and valid test programs, which are then used to test compilers. We implement this idea in a tool, LegoFuzz, for testing C compilers. The results are striking: we found 66 bugs in GCC and LLVM, the most widely used C compilers. Almost half of the bugs are miscompilation bugs, which are serious and hard-to-find bugs that none of the existing LLM-based tools could find. We believe this efficient design opens up new possibilities for using AI models in software testing beyond just C compilers.</p></details> |  |

However, little is known about how open-source projects use and customize these tools. Aims: This paper investigates how GitHub projects use and customize a popular SCA tool, namely SonarQube Cloud. Method: We conducted a mining study of GitHub projects that are linked through GitHub Actions to SonarQube Cloud projects. Results: Among 321 GitHub projects using SonarQube Cloud, 81% of them are correctly connected to SonarQube Cloud projects, while others exhibit misconfigurations or restricted access. Among 265 accessible SonarQube Cloud projects, 75% use the organization's default quality gate, i.e., a set of conditions that deployed source code must meet to pass automated checks. While 55% of the projects use the built-in quality gate provided by SonarQube Cloud, 45% of them customize their quality gate with different conditions. Overall, the most common quality conditions align with SonarQube Cloud's "Clean as You Code" principle and enforce security, maintainability, reliability, coverage, and a few duplicates on newly added or modified source code. Conclusions: Many projects rely on predefined configurations, yet a significant portion customize their configurations to meet specific quality goals. Building on our initial results, we envision a future research agenda linking quality gate configurations to actual software outcomes (e.g., improvement of software security). This would enable evidence-based recommendations for configuring SCA tools like SonarQube Cloud in various contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for ESEM25 NIER track</p></details> |

A Case Study of GitHub Actions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18771v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI-based code review tools automatically review and comment on pull requests to improve code quality. Despite their growing presence, little is known about their actual impact. We present a large-scale empirical study of 16 popular AI-based code review actions for GitHub workflows, analyzing more than 22,000 review comments in 178 repositories. We investigate (1) how these tools are adopted and configured, (2) whether their comments lead to code changes, and (3) which factors influence their effectiveness. We develop a two-stage LLM-assisted framework to determine whether review comments are addressed, and use interpretable machine learning to identify influencing factors. Our findings show that, while adoption is growing, effectiveness varies widely. Comments that are concise, contain code snippets, and are manually triggered, particularly those from hunk-level review tools, are more likely to result in code changes. These results highlight the importance of careful tool design and suggest directions for improving AI-based code review systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data Requirement Goal Modeling for Machine Learning Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07664v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine Learning (ML) has been integrated into various software and systems. Two main components are essential for training an ML model: the training data and the ML algorithm. Given the critical role of data in ML system development, it has become increasingly important to assess the quality of data attributes and ensure that the data meets specific requirements before its utilization. This work proposes an approach to guide non-experts in identifying data requirements for ML systems using goal modeling. In this approach, we first develop the Data Requirement Goal Model (DRGM) by surveying the white literature to identify and categorize the issues and challenges faced by data scientists and requirement engineers working on ML-related projects. An initial DRGM was built to accommodate common tasks that would generalize across projects. Then, based on insights from both white and gray literature, a customization mechanism is built to help adjust the tasks, KPIs, and goals' importance of different elements within the DRGM. The generated model can aid its users in evaluating different datasets using GRL evaluation strategies. We then validate the approach through two illustrative examples based on real-world projects. The results from the illustrative examples demonstrate that the data requirements identified by the proposed approach align with the requirements of real-world projects, demonstrating the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed framework. The proposed dataset selection customization mechanism and the proposed DRGM are helpful in guiding non-experts in identifying the data requirements for machine learning systems tailored to a specific ML problem. This approach also aids in evaluating different dataset alternatives to choose the optimum dataset for the problem. For future work, we recommend implementing tool support to generate the DRGM based on a chatbot interface.</p></details> |  |
| **[SoK: A Literature and Engineering Review of Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11618v4)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a vulnerability class that has become prominent in recent years. Attackers can weaponize such weaknesses as part of asymmetric cyberattacks that exploit the slow worst-case matching time of regular expression (regex) engines. In the past, problematic regexes have led to outages at Cloudflare and Stack Overflow, showing the severity of the problem. While ReDoS has drawn significant research attention, there has been no systematization of knowledge to delineate the state of the art and identify opportunities for further research. In this paper, we describe the existing knowledge on ReDoS. We first provide a systematic literature review, discussing approaches for detecting, preventing, and mitigating ReDoS vulnerabilities. Then, our engineering review surveys the latest regex engines to examine whether and how ReDoS defenses have been realized. Combining our findings, we observe that (1) in the literature, almost no studies evaluate whether and how ReDoS vulnerabilities can be weaponized against real systems, making it difficult to assess their real-world impact; and (2) from an engineering view, many mainstream regex engines have introduced partial or full ReDoS defenses, rendering many threat models obsolete. We conclude by highlighting avenues for future work. The open challenges in ReDoS research are to evaluate emerging defenses and support engineers in migrating to defended engines. We also highlight the parallel between performance bugs and asymmetric DoS, and we argue that future work should capitalize more on this similarity and adopt a more systematic view on ReDoS-like vulnerabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 5 figures.

The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed a revolutionary breakthrough in this area. However, existing methods that only rely on LLMs remain inadequate in the quality of generated code, offering no guarantees of satisfying practical requirements. They lack a systematic strategy for requirements development and modeling. Recently, LLM-based agents typically possess powerful abilities and play an essential role in facilitating the alignment of LLM outputs with user requirements. In this paper, we envision the first multi-agent framework for reliable code generation based on \textsc{re}quirements \textsc{de}velopment and \textsc{fo}rmalization, named \textsc{ReDeFo}. This framework incorporates three agents, highlighting their augmentation with knowledge and techniques of formal methods, into the requirements-to-code generation pipeline to strengthen quality assurance. The core of \textsc{ReDeFo} is the use of formal specifications to bridge the gap between potentially ambiguous natural language requirements and precise executable code. \textsc{ReDeFo} enables rigorous reasoning about correctness, uncovering hidden bugs, and enforcing critical properties throughout the development process. In general, our framework aims to take a promising step toward realizing the long-standing vision of reliable, auto-generated software.</p></details> |  |

As LLM deployments become prevalent, particularly in industry, ensuring their secure and reliable operation has become a critical issue. However, insecure defaults and misconfigurations often expose LLM services to the public internet, posing serious security and system engineering risks. This study conducted a large-scale empirical investigation of public-facing LLM deployments, focusing on the prevalence of services, exposure characteristics, systemic vulnerabilities, and associated risks. Through internet-wide measurements, we identified 320,102 public-facing LLM services across 15 frameworks and extracted 158 unique API endpoints, categorized into 12 functional groups based on functionality and security risk. Our analysis found that over 40% of endpoints used plain HTTP, and over 210,000 endpoints lacked valid TLS metadata. API exposure was highly inconsistent: some frameworks, such as Ollama, responded to over 35% of unauthenticated API requests, with about 15% leaking model or system information, while other frameworks implemented stricter controls. We observed widespread use of insecure protocols, poor TLS configurations, and unauthenticated access to critical operations. These security risks, such as model leakage, system compromise, and unauthorized access, are pervasive and highlight the need for a secure-by-default framework and stronger deployment practices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adapting Large Language Models to Log Analysis with Interpretable Domain Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01377v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Log analysis represents a critical sub-domain within AI applications that facilitates automatic approaches to fault and error management of large-scaled software systems, saving labors of traditional manual methods. While existing solutions using large language models (LLMs) show promise, they are limited by a significant domain gap between natural and log languages (the latter contains rich domain-specific tokens such as status codes, IP addresses, resource pathes), which restricts their effectiveness in real-world applications. However, directly adapting general-purpose LLMs to log analysis using raw logs may degrade their performance due to inconsistent token distribution. In this paper, we present a domain adaptation approach that addresses these limitations by integrating interpretable domain knowledge into open-source LLMs through continual pre-training (CPT), which bridges this domain gap by adapting LLMs on interpretable natural texts with log knowledge (instead of raw logs) to reduce distribution discrepancy. To achieve this, we developed NLPLog, a comprehensive dataset containing over 250,000 question-answer pairs on log-related knowledge. Our resulting model, SuperLog, achieves the best performance across four log analysis tasks, with an average accuracy improvement of 12.01% over the second-best model. Ablation study also suggests advantages of domain adaption using interpretable log knowledge over using raw logs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2025</p></details> |

However, most existing approaches focus on mainstream languages such as Python and Java, neglecting the Solidity language, the predominant programming language for Ethereum smart contracts. Due to the lack of adequate benchmarks for Solidity, LLMs' ability to generate secure, cost-effective smart contracts remains unexplored. To fill this gap, we construct SolEval, the first repository-level benchmark designed for Solidity smart contract generation, to evaluate the performance of LLMs on Solidity. SolEval consists of 1,507 samples from 28 different repositories, covering 6 popular domains, providing LLMs with a comprehensive evaluation benchmark. Unlike the existing Solidity benchmark, SolEval not only includes complex function calls but also reflects the real-world complexity of the Ethereum ecosystem by incorporating Gas@k and Vul@k. We evaluate 16 LLMs on SolEval, and our results show that the best-performing LLM achieves only 26.29% Pass@10, highlighting substantial room for improvement in Solidity code generation by LLMs. Additionally, we conduct supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on Qwen-7B using SolEval, resulting in a significant performance improvement, with Pass@5 increasing from 16.67% to 58.33%, demonstrating the effectiveness of fine-tuning LLMs on our benchmark.

However, the current methods for ranking and recommending apps in these stores mostly rely on static metrics like user activity and favorites, which makes it hard for users to efficiently find high-quality apps. To address these challenges, we propose LaQual, an automated framework for evaluating the quality of LLM apps. LaQual consists of three main stages: first, it labels and classifies LLM apps in a hierarchical way to accurately match them to different scenarios; second, it uses static indicators, such as time-weighted user engagement and functional capability metrics, to filter out low-quality apps; and third, it conducts a dynamic, scenario-adaptive evaluation, where the LLM itself generates scenario-specific evaluation metrics, scoring rules, and tasks for a thorough quality assessment. Experiments on a popular LLM app store show that LaQual is effective. Its automated scores are highly consistent with human judgments (with Spearman's rho of 0.62 and p=0.006 in legal consulting, and rho of 0.60 and p=0.009 in travel planning). By effectively screening, LaQual can reduce the pool of candidate LLM apps by 66.7% to 81.3%. User studies further confirm that LaQual significantly outperforms baseline systems in decision confidence, comparison efficiency (with average scores of 5.45 compared to 3.30), and the perceived value of its evaluation reports (4.75 versus 2.25). Overall, these results demonstrate that LaQual offers a scalable, objective, and user-centered solution for finding and recommending high-quality LLM apps in real-world use cases.</p></details> |  |

However, since existing approaches either demand the existence of multi-line similar code or randomly reference existing code, they can only repair a small number of bugs with many incorrect patches, hindering their wide application in practice. In this work, we aim to improve the effectiveness of redundancy-based APRs by exploring more effective source code reuse methods for improving the number of correct patches and reducing incorrect patches. Specifically, we have proposed a new repair technique named Repatt, which incorporates a two-level pattern mining process for guiding effective patch generation (i.e., token and expression levels). We have conducted an extensive experiment on the widely-used Defects4J benchmark and compared Repatt with ten state-of-the-art APR approaches. The results show that it complements existing approaches by repairing 9 unique bugs compared with the latest Large Language Model (LLM)-based and deep learning-based methods and 19 unique bugs compared with traditional repair methods when providing the perfect fault localization. In addition, when the perfect fault localization is unknown in real practice, Repatt significantly outperforms the baseline approaches by achieving much higher patch precision, i.e., 83.8\%, although it repairs fewer bugs. Moreover, we further proposed an effective patch ranking strategy for combining the strength of Repatt and the baseline methods. The result shows that it repairs 124 bugs when only considering the Top-1 patches and improves the best-performing repair method by repairing 39 more bugs. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for practical use.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ICSME 2025</p></details> |

| **[Reusable Test Suites for Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21553v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) agents show great promise in solving sequential decision-making tasks. However, validating the reliability and performance of the agent policies' behavior for deployment remains challenging. Most reinforcement learning policy testing methods produce test suites tailored to the agent policy being tested, and their relevance to other policies is unclear. This work presents Multi-Policy Test Case Selection (MPTCS), a novel automated test suite selection method for RL environments, designed to extract test cases generated by any policy testing framework based on their solvability, diversity, and general difficulty. MPTCS uses a set of policies to select a diverse collection of reusable policy-agnostic test cases that reveal typical flaws in the agents' behavior. The set of policies selects test cases from a candidate pool, which can be generated by any policy testing method, based on a difficulty score. We assess the effectiveness of the difficulty score and how the method's effectiveness and cost depend on the number of policies in the set. Additionally, a method for promoting diversity in the test suite, a discretized general test case descriptor surface inspired by quality-diversity algorithms, is examined to determine how it covers the state space and which policies it triggers to produce faulty behaviors.</p></details> |  |
| **[RepoMark: A Code Usage Auditing Framework for Code Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21432v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation has transformed software development by automating coding tasks with unprecedented efficiency. However, the training of these models on open-source code repositories (e.g., from GitHub) raises critical ethical and legal concerns, particularly regarding data authorization and open-source license compliance. Developers are increasingly questioning whether model trainers have obtained proper authorization before using repositories for training, especially given the lack of transparency in data collection. To address these concerns, we propose a novel data marking framework RepoMark to audit the data usage of code LLMs. Our method enables repository owners to verify whether their code has been used in training, while ensuring semantic preservation, imperceptibility, and theoretical false detection rate (FDR) guarantees. By generating multiple semantically equivalent code variants, RepoMark introduces data marks into the code files, and during detection, RepoMark leverages a novel ranking-based hypothesis test to detect memorization within the model. Compared to prior data auditing approaches, RepoMark significantly enhances sample efficiency, allowing effective auditing even when the user's repository possesses only a small number of code files. Experiments demonstrate that RepoMark achieves a detection success rate over 90\% on small code repositories under a strict FDR guarantee of 5\%. This represents a significant advancement over existing data marking techniques, all of which only achieve accuracy below 55\% under identical settings. This further validates RepoMark as a robust, theoretically sound, and promising solution for enhancing transparency in code LLM training, which can safeguard the rights of repository owners.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Automated Detection of Inline Code Comment Smells](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18956v2)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code comments are important in software development because they directly influence software maintainability and overall quality. Bad practices of code comments lead to code comment smells, negatively impacting software maintenance. Recent research has been conducted on classifying inline code comment smells, yet automatically detecting these still remains a challenge. We aim to automatically detect and classify inline code comment smells through machine learning (ML) models and a large language model (LLM) to determine how accurately each smell type can be detected. We enhanced a previously labeled dataset, where comments are labeled according to a determined taxonomy, by augmenting it with additional code segments and their associated comments. GPT 4, a large language model, was used to classify code comment smells on both the original and augmented datasets to evaluate its performance. In parallel, we trained and tested seven different machine learning algorithms on the augmented dataset to compare their classification performance against GPT 4. The performance of models, particularly Random Forest, which achieved an overall accuracy of 69 percent, along with Gradient Boosting and Logistic Regression, each achieving 66 percent and 65 percent, respectively, establishes a solid baseline for future research in this domain. The Random Forest model outperformed all other ML models, by achieving the highest Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) score of 0.44. The augmented dataset improved the overall classification accuracy of the GPT 4 model predictions from 34 percent to 55 percent. This study contributes to software maintainability by exploring the automatic detection and classification of inline code comment smells. We have made our augmented dataset and code artifacts available online, offering a valuable resource for developing automated comment smell detection tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Locus: Agentic Predicate Synthesis for Directed Fuzzing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21302v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Directed fuzzing aims to find program inputs that lead to specified target program states. It has broad applications, such as debugging system crashes, confirming reported bugs, and generating exploits for potential vulnerabilities. This task is inherently challenging because target states are often deeply nested in the program, while the search space manifested by numerous possible program inputs is prohibitively large. Existing approaches rely on branch distances or manually-specified constraints to guide the search; however, the branches alone are often insufficient to precisely characterize progress toward reaching the target states, while the manually specified constraints are often tailored for specific bug types and thus difficult to generalize to diverse target states and programs. We present Locus, a novel framework to improve the efficiency of directed fuzzing. Our key insight is to synthesize predicates to capture fuzzing progress as semantically meaningful intermediate states, serving as milestones towards reaching the target states. When used to instrument the program under fuzzing, they can reject executions unlikely to reach the target states, while providing additional coverage guidance. To automate this task and generalize to diverse programs, Locus features an agentic framework with program analysis tools to synthesize and iteratively refine the candidate predicates, while ensuring the predicates strictly relax the target states to prevent false rejections via symbolic execution. Our evaluation shows that Locus substantially improves the efficiency of eight state-of-the-art fuzzers in discovering real-world vulnerabilities, achieving an average speedup of 41.6x. So far, Locus has found eight previously unpatched bugs, with one already acknowledged with a draft patch.</p></details> |  |

Yet, many papers do not meet such requirements. The uniqueness of HPC infrastructure and software, coupled with strict access requirements, may limit opportunities for reproducibility. In the absence of resource access, we believe that regular documented testing, through continuous integration (CI), coupled with complete provenance information, can be used as a substitute. Here, we argue that better HPC-compliant CI solutions will improve reproducibility of applications. We present a survey of reproducibility initiatives and describe the barriers to reproducibility in HPC. To address existing limitations, we present a GitHub Action, CORRECT, that enables secure execution of tests on remote HPC resources. We evaluate CORRECT's usability across three different types of HPC applications, demonstrating the effectiveness of using CORRECT for automating and documenting reproducibility evaluations.</p></details> |  |

We present a lightweight framework that instruction-tuned large language model (LLM) with LoRA adapters and uses candidate-constrained decoding to ensure valid assignments. Tested on EclipseJDT and Mozilla datasets, the model achieves strong shortlist quality (Hit at 10 up to 0.753) despite modest exact Top-1 accuracy. On recent snapshots, accuracy rises sharply, showing the framework's potential for real-world, human-in-the-loop triaging. Our results suggest that instruction-tuned LLMs offer a practical alternative to costly feature engineering and graph-based methods.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Characterizing Trust Boundary Vulnerabilities in TEE Containers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20962v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) have emerged as a cornerstone of confidential computing, garnering significant attention from both academia and industry. To enable the secure development, execution, and deployment, of applications on TEE platforms, TEE containers have been introduced as middleware solutions. These containers aim to shield applications from potentially malicious operating systems and orchestration interfaces while maintaining usability and reliability. In this paper, we analyze the isolation strategies employed by existing TEE containers to protect secure applications. To address the challenges in analyzing these interfaces, we designed an automated analyzer to precisely identify and evaluate their isolation boundaries. We observed that some TEE containers fail to achieve their intended goals due to critical design and implementation flaws, such as information leakage, rollback attacks, denial-of-service, and Iago attacks, which pose significant security risks. Drawing from our findings, we share key lessons to guide the development of more secure container solutions and discuss emerging trends in TEE containerization design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Test Oracles for Flaky Cyber-Physical System Simulators: Approach and Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20902v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulation-based testing of cyber-physical systems (CPS) is costly due to the time-consuming execution of CPS simulators. In addition, CPS simulators may be flaky, leading to inconsistent test outcomes and requiring repeated test re-execution for reliable test verdicts. Automated test oracles that do not require system execution are therefore crucial for reducing testing costs. Ideally, such test oracles should be interpretable to facilitate human understanding of test verdicts, and they must be robust against the potential flakiness of CPS simulators. In this article, we propose assertion-based test oracles for CPS as sets of logical and arithmetic predicates defined over the inputs of the system under test. Given a test input, our assertion-based test oracle determines, without requiring test execution, whether the test passes, fails, or if the oracle is inconclusive in predicting a verdict. We describe two methods for generating assertion-based test oracles: one using genetic programming~(GP) that employs well-known spectrum-based fault localization (SBFL) ranking formulas, namely Ochiai, Tarantula, and Naish, as fitness functions; and the other using decision trees (DT) and decision rules (DR). We evaluate our assertion-based test oracles through case studies in the domains of aerospace, networking and autonomous driving. We show that test oracles generated using GP with Ochiai are significantly more accurate than those obtained using GP with Tarantula and Naish or using DT or DR. Moreover, this accuracy advantage remains even when accounting for the flakiness of the system under test. We further show that the assertion-based test oracles generated by GP with Ochiai are robust against flakiness with only 4% average variation in their accuracy results across four different network and autonomous driving systems with flaky behaviours.</p></details> |  |

Given the challenges in writing comprehensive unit tests, LLMs have been employed to automate test generation, yet methods for training LLMs to produce high-quality tests remain underexplored. In this work, we propose UTRL, a novel reinforcement learning framework that trains an LLM to generate high-quality unit tests given a programming instruction. Our key idea is to iteratively train two LLMs, the unit test generator and the code generator, in an adversarial manner via reinforcement learning. The unit test generator is trained to maximize a discrimination reward, which reflects its ability to produce tests that expose faults in the code generator's solutions, and the code generator is trained to maximize a code reward, which reflects its ability to produce solutions that pass the unit tests generated by the test generator. In our experiments, we demonstrate that unit tests generated by Qwen3-4B trained via UTRL show higher quality compared to unit tests generated by the same model trained via supervised fine-tuning on human-written ground-truth unit tests, yielding code evaluations that more closely align with those induced by the ground-truth tests. Moreover, Qwen3-4B trained with UTRL outperforms frontier models such as GPT-4.1 in generating high-quality unit tests, highlighting the effectiveness of UTRL in training LLMs for this task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at: https://github.com/dgjun32/UTRL</p></details> |

| **[From Law to Gherkin: A Human-Centred Quasi-Experiment on the Quality of LLM-Generated Behavioural Specifications from Food-Safety Regulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20744v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Laws and regulations increasingly affect software design and quality assurance, but legal texts are written in technology-neutral language. This creates challenges for engineers who must develop compliance artifacts such as requirements and acceptance criteria. Manual creation is labor-intensive, error-prone, and requires domain expertise. Advances in Generative AI (GenAI), especially Large Language Models (LLMs), offer a way to automate deriving such artifacts. Objective: We present the first systematic human-subject study of LLMs' ability to derive behavioral specifications from legal texts using a quasi-experimental design. These specifications translate legal requirements into a developer-friendly form. Methods: Ten participants evaluated specifications generated from food-safety regulations by Claude and Llama. Using Gherkin, a structured BDD language, 60 specifications were produced. Each participant assessed 12 across five criteria: Relevance, Clarity, Completeness, Singularity, and Time Savings. Each specification was reviewed by two participants, yielding 120 assessments. Results: For Relevance, 75% of ratings were highest and 20% second-highest. Clarity reached 90% highest. Completeness: 75% highest, 19% second. Singularity: 82% highest, 12% second. Time Savings: 68% highest, 24% second. No lowest ratings occurred. Mann-Whitney U tests showed no significant differences across participants or models. Llama slightly outperformed Claude in Clarity, Completeness, and Time Savings, while Claude was stronger in Singularity. Feedback noted hallucinations and omissions but confirmed the utility of the specifications. Conclusion: LLMs can generate high-quality Gherkin specifications from legal texts, reducing manual effort and providing structured artifacts useful for implementation, assurance, and test generation.</p></details> |  |

Their inherent non-determinism, dynamism, and context dependence pose fundamental challenges for quality assurance. This paper decomposes LLM applications into a three-layer architecture: \textbf{\textit{System Shell Layer}}, \textbf{\textit{Prompt Orchestration Layer}}, and \textbf{\textit{LLM Inference Core}}. We then assess the applicability of traditional software testing methods in each layer: directly applicable at the shell layer, requiring semantic reinterpretation at the orchestration layer, and necessitating paradigm shifts at the inference core. A comparative analysis of Testing AI methods from the software engineering community and safety analysis techniques from the AI community reveals structural disconnects in testing unit abstraction, evaluation metrics, and lifecycle management. We identify four fundamental differences that underlie 6 core challenges. To address these, we propose four types of collaborative strategies (\emph{Retain}, \emph{Translate}, \emph{Integrate}, and \emph{Runtime}) and explore a closed-loop, trustworthy quality assurance framework that combines pre-deployment validation with runtime monitoring. Based on these strategies, we offer practical guidance and a protocol proposal to support the standardization and tooling of LLM application testing. We propose a protocol \textbf{\textit{Agent Interaction Communication Language}} (AICL) that is used to communicate between AI agents. AICL has the test-oriented features and is easily integrated in the current agent framework.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a large-scale comparison of code authored by human developers and three state-of-the-art LLMs, i.e., ChatGPT, DeepSeek-Coder, and Qwen-Coder, on multiple dimensions of software quality: code defects, security vulnerabilities, and structural complexity. Our evaluation spans over 500k code samples in two widely used languages, Python and Java, classifying defects via Orthogonal Defect Classification and security vulnerabilities using the Common Weakness Enumeration. We find that AI-generated code is generally simpler and more repetitive, yet more prone to unused constructs and hardcoded debugging, while human-written code exhibits greater structural complexity and a higher concentration of maintainability issues. Notably, AI-generated code also contains more high-risk security vulnerabilities. These findings highlight the distinct defect profiles of AI- and human-authored code and underscore the need for specialized quality assurance practices in AI-assisted programming.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 36th IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE, 2025)</p></details> |

However, existing frameworks continue to suffer from the propagation of incorrect facts. A major limitation stems from their insufficient semantic understanding of code, resulting in overly conservative treatment of user-defined functions. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) present new opportunities to bridge this gap. In this paper, we propose LMPA (LLM-enhanced Pointer Analysis), a vision that integrates LLMs into pointer analysis to enhance both precision and scalability. LMPA identifies user-defined functions that resemble system APIs and models them accordingly, thereby mitigating erroneous cross-calling-context propagation. Furthermore, it enhances summary-based analysis by inferring initial points-to sets and introducing a novel summary strategy augmented with natural language. Finally, we discuss the key challenges involved in realizing this vision.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by LMPL 2025</p></details> |
| **[The Complexity Trap: Simple Observation Masking Is as Efficient as LLM Summarization for Agent Context Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21433v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents solve complex tasks through iterative reasoning, exploration, and tool-use, a process that can result in long, expensive context histories. While state-of-the-art Software Engineering ( SE) agents like OpenHands or Cursor use LLM-based summarization to tackle this issue, it is unclear whether the increased complexity offers tangible performance benefits compared to simply omitting older observations. We present a systematic comparison of these strategies within SWE-agent on SWE-bench Verified across five diverse model configurations. We find that a simple observation-masking strategy halves cost relative to a raw agent while matching, and sometimes slightly exceeding, the solve rate of LLM summarization. For example, with Qwen3-Coder 480B, masking improves solve rate from 53.8% (raw agent) to 54.8%, while remaining competitive with summarization at a lower cost. These results suggest that, at least within SWE-agent on SWE-bench Verified, the most effective and efficient context management can be the simplest. We release code and data for reproducibility</p></details> |  |

However, the training of these models on open-source code repositories (e.g., from GitHub) raises critical ethical and legal concerns, particularly regarding data authorization and open-source license compliance. Developers are increasingly questioning whether model trainers have obtained proper authorization before using repositories for training, especially given the lack of transparency in data collection. To address these concerns, we propose a novel data marking framework RepoMark to audit the data usage of code LLMs. Our method enables repository owners to verify whether their code has been used in training, while ensuring semantic preservation, imperceptibility, and theoretical false detection rate (FDR) guarantees. By generating multiple semantically equivalent code variants, RepoMark introduces data marks into the code files, and during detection, RepoMark leverages a novel ranking-based hypothesis test to detect memorization within the model. Compared to prior data auditing approaches, RepoMark significantly enhances sample efficiency, allowing effective auditing even when the user's repository possesses only a small number of code files. Experiments demonstrate that RepoMark achieves a detection success rate over 90\% on small code repositories under a strict FDR guarantee of 5\%. This represents a significant advancement over existing data marking techniques, all of which only achieve accuracy below 55\% under identical settings.

| **[An Empirical Study of Vulnerable Package Dependencies in LLM Repositories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21417v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have developed rapidly in recent years, revolutionizing various fields. Despite their widespread success, LLMs heavily rely on external code dependencies from package management systems, creating a complex and interconnected LLM dependency supply chain. Vulnerabilities in dependencies can expose LLMs to security risks. While existing research predominantly focuses on model-level security threats, vulnerabilities within the LLM dependency supply chain have been overlooked. To fill this gap, we conducted an empirical analysis of 52 open-source LLMs, examining their third-party dependencies and associated vulnerabilities. We then explored activities within the LLM repositories to understand how maintainers manage third-party vulnerabilities in practice. Finally, we compared third-party dependency vulnerabilities in the LLM ecosystem to those in the Python ecosystem. Our results show that half of the vulnerabilities in the LLM ecosystem remain undisclosed for more than 56.2 months, significantly longer than those in the Python ecosystem. Additionally, 75.8% of LLMs include vulnerable dependencies in their configuration files. This study advances the understanding of LLM supply chain risks, provides insights for practitioners, and highlights potential directions for improving the security of the LLM supply chain.</p></details> |  |

Existing diagnosability supports focus on post-failure analysis of software behavior to identify configuration issues, but none of these approaches look into whether the software clue sufficient failure information for diagnosis. To fill in the blank, we propose the idea of configuration logging to enhance existing logging practices at the source code level. We develop ConfLogger, the first tool that unifies configuration-aware static taint analysis with LLM-based log generation to enhance software configuration diagnosability. Specifically, our method 1) identifies configuration-sensitive code segments by tracing configuration-related data flow in the whole project, and 2) generates diagnostic log statements by analyzing configuration code contexts. Evaluation results on eight popular software systems demonstrate the effectiveness of ConfLogger to enhance configuration diagnosability. Specifically, ConfLogger-enhanced logs successfully aid a log-based misconfiguration diagnosis tool to achieve 100% accuracy on error localization in 30 silent misconfiguration scenarios, with 80% directly resolvable through explicit configuration information exposed. In addition, ConfLogger achieves 74% coverage of existing logging points, outperforming baseline LLM-based loggers by 12% and 30%. It also gains 8.6% higher in precision, 79.3% higher in recall, and 26.2% higher in F1 compared to the state-of-the-art baseline in terms of variable logging while also augmenting diagnostic value. A controlled user study on 22 cases further validated its utility, speeding up diagnostic time by 1.25x and improving troubleshooting accuracy by 251.4%.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, accepted by ICSE '26 (The 48th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering)</p></details> |

We explore the intuition that LLM can potentially infer program dynamics based on a partially recorded trace and relevant code as its context. Given (1) a partially recorded trace of a program $P$ and (2) the slicing criteria consisting of a query step $s$ and a query variable $v$ read by $s$, RecovSlicing computes the runtime definition of $v$ on the trace by estimating the miss-recorded execution of $P$. In this work, we allow the user to specify implicit query variable, for example, the implicit library variable used in list{\ttfamily .}get(i). Technically, built upon non-deterministic LLM, we address the challenges of (1) precise recovery of runtime variable value and structure from the recorded execution and (2) aligning the memory address of recovered variables and the recorded variables for definition analysis. We extensively evaluate RecovSlicing against the state-of-the-art slicers such as Slicer4J, ND-Slicer, LLM Slicer, and re-execution Slicer on a total number of 8300 data-dependencies over 3 slicing benchmarks. The results show that RecovSlicing can significantly outperform the baselines. The accuracy and recall, achieving 80.3%, 91.1%, and 98.3% on the three benchmarks, whereas the best baseline reaches 39.0%, 82.0%, and 59.9% (accuracy), and 53.4%, 79.1%, and 87.1% (recall), respectively. In addition, we integrate RecovSlicing in a dual-slicing based regression bug localizer, significantly improving its performance by locating 16% more regressions.</p></details> |  |

However, this flexibility often introduces code quality issues, with prior studies showing that approximately 76% of public notebooks are non-executable, raising significant concerns about reusability. We argue that the traditional notion of executability - requiring a notebook to run fully and without error - is overly rigid, misclassifying many notebooks and overestimating their non-executability. This paper investigates pathological executability issues in public notebooks under varying notions and degrees of executability. Even partially improving executability can improve code comprehension and offer a pathway for dynamic analyses. With this insight, we first categorize notebooks into potentially restorable and pathological non-executable notebooks and then measure how removing misconfiguration and superficial execution issues in notebooks can improve their executability (i.e., additional cells executed without error). In a dataset of 42,546 popular public notebooks containing 34,659 non-executable notebooks, only 21.3% are truly pathologically non-executable. For restorable notebooks, LLM-based methods fully restore 5.4% of previously non-executable notebooks. Among the partially restored, the executability of notebooks improves by 42.7% and 28% by installing the correct modules and generating synthetic data. These findings challenge prior assumptions, suggesting that notebooks have higher executability than previously reported, many of which offer valuable partial execution, and that their executability should be evaluated within the interactive notebook paradigm rather than through traditional software executability standards.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables, the 22nd International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR 2025)</p></details> |

We present a lightweight framework that instruction-tuned large language model (LLM) with LoRA adapters and uses candidate-constrained decoding to ensure valid assignments. Tested on EclipseJDT and Mozilla datasets, the model achieves strong shortlist quality (Hit at 10 up to 0.753) despite modest exact Top-1 accuracy. On recent snapshots, accuracy rises sharply, showing the framework's potential for real-world, human-in-the-loop triaging. Our results suggest that instruction-tuned LLMs offer a practical alternative to costly feature engineering and graph-based methods.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Learning to Generate Unit Test via Adversarial Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21107v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unit testing is a core practice in programming, enabling systematic evaluation of programs produced by human developers or large language models (LLMs). Given the challenges in writing comprehensive unit tests, LLMs have been employed to automate test generation, yet methods for training LLMs to produce high-quality tests remain underexplored. In this work, we propose UTRL, a novel reinforcement learning framework that trains an LLM to generate high-quality unit tests given a programming instruction. Our key idea is to iteratively train two LLMs, the unit test generator and the code generator, in an adversarial manner via reinforcement learning. The unit test generator is trained to maximize a discrimination reward, which reflects its ability to produce tests that expose faults in the code generator's solutions, and the code generator is trained to maximize a code reward, which reflects its ability to produce solutions that pass the unit tests generated by the test generator. In our experiments, we demonstrate that unit tests generated by Qwen3-4B trained via UTRL show higher quality compared to unit tests generated by the same model trained via supervised fine-tuning on human-written ground-truth unit tests, yielding code evaluations that more closely align with those induced by the ground-truth tests. Moreover, Qwen3-4B trained with UTRL outperforms frontier models such as GPT-4.1 in generating high-quality unit tests, highlighting the effectiveness of UTRL in training LLMs for this task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at: https://github.com/dgjun32/UTRL</p></details> |

However, when the system operates in dynamic environments, the workload variations, hardware changes, and system updates will inevitably introduce concept drifts at different levels - global drifts, which reshape the performance landscape of the entire configuration space; and local drifts, which only affect certain sub-regions of that space. As such, existing offline and transfer learning approaches can struggle to adapt to these implicit and unpredictable changes in real-time, rendering configuration performance learning challenging. To address this, we propose DHDA, an online configuration performance learning framework designed to capture and adapt to these drifts at different levels. The key idea is that DHDA adapts to both the local and global drifts using dually hierarchical adaptation: at the upper level, we redivide the data into different divisions, within each of which the local model is retrained, to handle global drifts only when necessary. At the lower level, the local models of the divisions can detect local drifts and adapt themselves asynchronously. To balance responsiveness and efficiency, DHDA combines incremental updates with periodic full retraining to minimize redundant computation when no drifts are detected. Through evaluating eight software systems and against state-of-the-art approaches, we show that DHDA achieves considerably better accuracy and can effectively adapt to drifts with up to 2x improvements, while incurring reasonable overhead and is able to improve different local models in handling concept drift.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICSE 2026</p></details> |

Existing approaches -- ownership systems, linear and affine types, uniqueness types, and lexical effect tracking -- impose global restrictions such as uniqueness or linearity, or rely on shallow syntactic analyses. These designs fall short with higher-order functions and shared mutable state. Reachability Types (RT) track aliasing and separation in higher-order programs, ensuring runtime safety and non-interference. However, RT systems face three key limitations: (1) they prohibit cyclic references, ruling out non-terminating computations and fixed-point combinators; (2) they require deep tracking, where a qualifier must include all transitively reachable locations, reducing precision and hindering optimizations like fine-grained parallelism; and (3) referent qualifier invariance prevents referents from escaping their allocation contexts, making reference factories inexpressible. In this work, we address these limitations by extending RT with three mechanisms that enhance expressiveness. First, we introduce cyclic references, enabling recursive patterns to be encoded directly through the store. Second, we adopt shallow qualifier tracking, decoupling references from their transitively reachable values. Finally, we introduce an escaping rule with reference subtyping, allowing referent qualifiers to outlive their allocation context.

Agile methodologies are replacing traditional approaches such as Waterfall, where flexibility, iterative development and adaptation to change are favoured over rigid planning and execution. DevOps, a subsequent evolution from Agile, emphasises collaborative efforts in development and operations teams, focusing on continuous integration and deployment to deliver resilient and high-quality software products and services. This study aims to critically assess both Agile and DevOps practices in the IT industry to identify the feasibility and applicability of Agile methods in DevOps practices. Eleven semi-structured interviews were conducted with Agile and DevOps practitioners in varying capacities across several sectors within the IT industry. Through thematic analysis, 51 unique codes were extracted and synthesised into 19 themes that reported on each phase of the DevOps lifecycle, specifically regarding the integration and implementation of Agile methods into DevOps practices. Based on the findings, a new understanding detailing the interrelationship of Agile methods in DevOps practices was discussed that met the research objectives.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 2 figures, conference</p></details> |

| **[Reusable Test Suites for Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21553v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) agents show great promise in solving sequential decision-making tasks. However, validating the reliability and performance of the agent policies' behavior for deployment remains challenging. Most reinforcement learning policy testing methods produce test suites tailored to the agent policy being tested, and their relevance to other policies is unclear. This work presents Multi-Policy Test Case Selection (MPTCS), a novel automated test suite selection method for RL environments, designed to extract test cases generated by any policy testing framework based on their solvability, diversity, and general difficulty. MPTCS uses a set of policies to select a diverse collection of reusable policy-agnostic test cases that reveal typical flaws in the agents' behavior. The set of policies selects test cases from a candidate pool, which can be generated by any policy testing method, based on a difficulty score. We assess the effectiveness of the difficulty score and how the method's effectiveness and cost depend on the number of policies in the set. Additionally, a method for promoting diversity in the test suite, a discretized general test case descriptor surface inspired by quality-diversity algorithms, is examined to determine how it covers the state space and which policies it triggers to produce faulty behaviors.</p></details> |  |

However, existing frameworks continue to suffer from the propagation of incorrect facts. A major limitation stems from their insufficient semantic understanding of code, resulting in overly conservative treatment of user-defined functions. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) present new opportunities to bridge this gap. In this paper, we propose LMPA (LLM-enhanced Pointer Analysis), a vision that integrates LLMs into pointer analysis to enhance both precision and scalability. LMPA identifies user-defined functions that resemble system APIs and models them accordingly, thereby mitigating erroneous cross-calling-context propagation. Furthermore, it enhances summary-based analysis by inferring initial points-to sets and introducing a novel summary strategy augmented with natural language. Finally, we discuss the key challenges involved in realizing this vision.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by LMPL 2025</p></details> |
| **[The Complexity Trap: Simple Observation Masking Is as Efficient as LLM Summarization for Agent Context Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21433v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents solve complex tasks through iterative reasoning, exploration, and tool-use, a process that can result in long, expensive context histories. While state-of-the-art Software Engineering ( SE) agents like OpenHands or Cursor use LLM-based summarization to tackle this issue, it is unclear whether the increased complexity offers tangible performance benefits compared to simply omitting older observations. We present a systematic comparison of these strategies within SWE-agent on SWE-bench Verified across five diverse model configurations. We find that a simple observation-masking strategy halves cost relative to a raw agent while matching, and sometimes slightly exceeding, the solve rate of LLM summarization. For example, with Qwen3-Coder 480B, masking improves solve rate from 53.8% (raw agent) to 54.8%, while remaining competitive with summarization at a lower cost. These results suggest that, at least within SWE-agent on SWE-bench Verified, the most effective and efficient context management can be the simplest. We release code and data for reproducibility</p></details> |  |
| **[RepoMark: A Code Usage Auditing Framework for Code Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21432v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation has transformed software development by automating coding tasks with unprecedented efficiency. However, the training of these models on open-source code repositories (e.g., from GitHub) raises critical ethical and legal concerns, particularly regarding data authorization and open-source license compliance. Developers are increasingly questioning whether model trainers have obtained proper authorization before using repositories for training, especially given the lack of transparency in data collection. To address these concerns, we propose a novel data marking framework RepoMark to audit the data usage of code LLMs. Our method enables repository owners to verify whether their code has been used in training, while ensuring semantic preservation, imperceptibility, and theoretical false detection rate (FDR) guarantees. By generating multiple semantically equivalent code variants, RepoMark introduces data marks into the code files, and during detection, RepoMark leverages a novel ranking-based hypothesis test to detect memorization within the model. Compared to prior data auditing approaches, RepoMark significantly enhances sample efficiency, allowing effective auditing even when the user's repository possesses only a small number of code files. Experiments demonstrate that RepoMark achieves a detection success rate over 90\% on small code repositories under a strict FDR guarantee of 5\%. This represents a significant advancement over existing data marking techniques, all of which only achieve accuracy below 55\% under identical settings. This further validates RepoMark as a robust, theoretically sound, and promising solution for enhancing transparency in code LLM training, which can safeguard the rights of repository owners.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Study of Vulnerable Package Dependencies in LLM Repositories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21417v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have developed rapidly in recent years, revolutionizing various fields. Despite their widespread success, LLMs heavily rely on external code dependencies from package management systems, creating a complex and interconnected LLM dependency supply chain. Vulnerabilities in dependencies can expose LLMs to security risks. While existing research predominantly focuses on model-level security threats, vulnerabilities within the LLM dependency supply chain have been overlooked. To fill this gap, we conducted an empirical analysis of 52 open-source LLMs, examining their third-party dependencies and associated vulnerabilities. We then explored activities within the LLM repositories to understand how maintainers manage third-party vulnerabilities in practice. Finally, we compared third-party dependency vulnerabilities in the LLM ecosystem to those in the Python ecosystem. Our results show that half of the vulnerabilities in the LLM ecosystem remain undisclosed for more than 56.2 months, significantly longer than those in the Python ecosystem. Additionally, 75.8% of LLMs include vulnerable dependencies in their configuration files. This study advances the understanding of LLM supply chain risks, provides insights for practitioners, and highlights potential directions for improving the security of the LLM supply chain.</p></details> |  |

Such an approach is also used in recent cyber security legislation enacted in the EU. Risks are also inherently related to compliance with the new legislation. Objective: The paper investigates how risks are framed in the EU's five core cyber security legislative acts, whether the framings indicate convergence or divergence between the acts and their risk concepts, and what qualifying words and terms are used when describing the legal notions of risks. Method : The paper's methodology is based on qualitative legal interpretation and taxonomy-building. Results: The five acts have an encompassing coverage of different cyber security risks, including but not limited to risks related to technical, organizational, and human security as well as those not originating from man-made actions. Both technical aspects and assets are used to frame the legal risk notions in many of the legislative acts. A threat-centric viewpoint is also present in one of the acts. Notable gaps are related to acceptable risks, non-probabilistic risks, and residual risks. Conclusion: The EU's new cyber security legislation has significantly extended the risk-based approach to regulations. At the same time, complexity and compliance burden have increased. With this point in mind, the paper concludes with a few practical takeaways about means to deal with compliance and research it.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IST (VSI:RegCompliance in SE)</p></details> |

Bad practices of code comments lead to code comment smells, negatively impacting software maintenance. Recent research has been conducted on classifying inline code comment smells, yet automatically detecting these still remains a challenge. We aim to automatically detect and classify inline code comment smells through machine learning (ML) models and a large language model (LLM) to determine how accurately each smell type can be detected. We enhanced a previously labeled dataset, where comments are labeled according to a determined taxonomy, by augmenting it with additional code segments and their associated comments. GPT 4, a large language model, was used to classify code comment smells on both the original and augmented datasets to evaluate its performance. In parallel, we trained and tested seven different machine learning algorithms on the augmented dataset to compare their classification performance against GPT 4. The performance of models, particularly Random Forest, which achieved an overall accuracy of 69 percent, along with Gradient Boosting and Logistic Regression, each achieving 66 percent and 65 percent, respectively, establishes a solid baseline for future research in this domain. The Random Forest model outperformed all other ML models, by achieving the highest Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) score of 0.44. The augmented dataset improved the overall classification accuracy of the GPT 4 model predictions from 34 percent to 55 percent. This study contributes to software maintainability by exploring the automatic detection and classification of inline code comment smells. We have made our augmented dataset and code artifacts available online, offering a valuable resource for developing automated comment smell detection tools.</p></details> |  |

To alleviate these challenges, AI simulation uses virtual training environments in which AI agents can be safely and efficiently developed with simulated, synthetic data. Digital twins open new avenues in AI simulation, as these high-fidelity virtual replicas of physical systems are equipped with state-of-the-art simulators and the ability to further interact with the physical system for additional data collection. In this article, we report on our systematic survey of digital twin-enabled AI simulation. By analyzing 22 primary studies, we identify technological trends and derive a reference framework to situate digital twins and AI components. Based on our findings, we derive a reference framework and provide architectural guidelines by mapping it onto the ISO 23247 reference architecture for digital twins. Finally, we identify challenges and research opportunities for prospective researchers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Locus: Agentic Predicate Synthesis for Directed Fuzzing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21302v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Directed fuzzing aims to find program inputs that lead to specified target program states. It has broad applications, such as debugging system crashes, confirming reported bugs, and generating exploits for potential vulnerabilities. This task is inherently challenging because target states are often deeply nested in the program, while the search space manifested by numerous possible program inputs is prohibitively large. Existing approaches rely on branch distances or manually-specified constraints to guide the search; however, the branches alone are often insufficient to precisely characterize progress toward reaching the target states, while the manually specified constraints are often tailored for specific bug types and thus difficult to generalize to diverse target states and programs. We present Locus, a novel framework to improve the efficiency of directed fuzzing. Our key insight is to synthesize predicates to capture fuzzing progress as semantically meaningful intermediate states, serving as milestones towards reaching the target states. When used to instrument the program under fuzzing, they can reject executions unlikely to reach the target states, while providing additional coverage guidance. To automate this task and generalize to diverse programs, Locus features an agentic framework with program analysis tools to synthesize and iteratively refine the candidate predicates, while ensuring the predicates strictly relax the target states to prevent false rejections via symbolic execution. Our evaluation shows that Locus substantially improves the efficiency of eight state-of-the-art fuzzers in discovering real-world vulnerabilities, achieving an average speedup of 41.6x. So far, Locus has found eight previously unpatched bugs, with one already acknowledged with a draft patch.</p></details> |  |

Existing diagnosability supports focus on post-failure analysis of software behavior to identify configuration issues, but none of these approaches look into whether the software clue sufficient failure information for diagnosis. To fill in the blank, we propose the idea of configuration logging to enhance existing logging practices at the source code level. We develop ConfLogger, the first tool that unifies configuration-aware static taint analysis with LLM-based log generation to enhance software configuration diagnosability. Specifically, our method 1) identifies configuration-sensitive code segments by tracing configuration-related data flow in the whole project, and 2) generates diagnostic log statements by analyzing configuration code contexts. Evaluation results on eight popular software systems demonstrate the effectiveness of ConfLogger to enhance configuration diagnosability. Specifically, ConfLogger-enhanced logs successfully aid a log-based misconfiguration diagnosis tool to achieve 100% accuracy on error localization in 30 silent misconfiguration scenarios, with 80% directly resolvable through explicit configuration information exposed. In addition, ConfLogger achieves 74% coverage of existing logging points, outperforming baseline LLM-based loggers by 12% and 30%. It also gains 8.6% higher in precision, 79.3% higher in recall, and 26.2% higher in F1 compared to the state-of-the-art baseline in terms of variable logging while also augmenting diagnostic value. A controlled user study on 22 cases further validated its utility, speeding up diagnostic time by 1.25x and improving troubleshooting accuracy by 251.4%.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, accepted by ICSE '26 (The 48th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering)</p></details> |
| **[Addressing Reproducibility Challenges in HPC with Continuous Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21289v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The high-performance computing (HPC) community has adopted incentive structures to motivate reproducible research, with major conferences awarding badges to papers that meet reproducibility requirements. Yet, many papers do not meet such requirements. The uniqueness of HPC infrastructure and software, coupled with strict access requirements, may limit opportunities for reproducibility. In the absence of resource access, we believe that regular documented testing, through continuous integration (CI), coupled with complete provenance information, can be used as a substitute. Here, we argue that better HPC-compliant CI solutions will improve reproducibility of applications. We present a survey of reproducibility initiatives and describe the barriers to reproducibility in HPC. To address existing limitations, we present a GitHub Action, CORRECT, that enables secure execution of tests on remote HPC resources. We evaluate CORRECT's usability across three different types of HPC applications, demonstrating the effectiveness of using CORRECT for automating and documenting reproducibility evaluations.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM as an Execution Estimator: Recovering Missing Dependency for Practical Time-travelling Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18721v4)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose RecovSlicing for computing dynamic data dependency in a single run, with only partial instrumentation. We explore the intuition that LLM can potentially infer program dynamics based on a partially recorded trace and relevant code as its context. Given (1) a partially recorded trace of a program $P$ and (2) the slicing criteria consisting of a query step $s$ and a query variable $v$ read by $s$, RecovSlicing computes the runtime definition of $v$ on the trace by estimating the miss-recorded execution of $P$. In this work, we allow the user to specify implicit query variable, for example, the implicit library variable used in list{\ttfamily .}get(i). Technically, built upon non-deterministic LLM, we address the challenges of (1) precise recovery of runtime variable value and structure from the recorded execution and (2) aligning the memory address of recovered variables and the recorded variables for definition analysis. We extensively evaluate RecovSlicing against the state-of-the-art slicers such as Slicer4J, ND-Slicer, LLM Slicer, and re-execution Slicer on a total number of 8300 data-dependencies over 3 slicing benchmarks. The results show that RecovSlicing can significantly outperform the baselines. The accuracy and recall, achieving 80.3%, 91.1%, and 98.3% on the three benchmarks, whereas the best baseline reaches 39.0%, 82.0%, and 59.9% (accuracy), and 53.4%, 79.1%, and 87.1% (recall), respectively. In addition, we integrate RecovSlicing in a dual-slicing based regression bug localizer, significantly improving its performance by locating 16% more regressions.</p></details> |  |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have made strides in code generation, they struggle to achieve high branch coverage due to their limited ability to reason about intricate control flow structures. To address this limitation, we introduce Panta, a technique that emulates the iterative process human developers follow when analyzing code and constructing test cases. Panta integrates static control flow analysis and dynamic code coverage analysis to systematically guide LLMs in identifying uncovered execution paths and generating better test cases. By incorporating an iterative feedback-driven mechanism, our technique continuously refines test generation based on static and dynamic path coverage insights, ensuring more comprehensive and effective testing. Our empirical evaluation, conducted on classes with high cyclomatic complexity from open-source projects, demonstrates that Panta achieves 26% higher line coverage and 23% higher branch coverage compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in 2026 IEEE/ACM 48th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2026)</p></details> |

However, this flexibility often introduces code quality issues, with prior studies showing that approximately 76% of public notebooks are non-executable, raising significant concerns about reusability. We argue that the traditional notion of executability - requiring a notebook to run fully and without error - is overly rigid, misclassifying many notebooks and overestimating their non-executability. This paper investigates pathological executability issues in public notebooks under varying notions and degrees of executability. Even partially improving executability can improve code comprehension and offer a pathway for dynamic analyses. With this insight, we first categorize notebooks into potentially restorable and pathological non-executable notebooks and then measure how removing misconfiguration and superficial execution issues in notebooks can improve their executability (i.e., additional cells executed without error). In a dataset of 42,546 popular public notebooks containing 34,659 non-executable notebooks, only 21.3% are truly pathologically non-executable. For restorable notebooks, LLM-based methods fully restore 5.4% of previously non-executable notebooks. Among the partially restored, the executability of notebooks improves by 42.7% and 28% by installing the correct modules and generating synthetic data. These findings challenge prior assumptions, suggesting that notebooks have higher executability than previously reported, many of which offer valuable partial execution, and that their executability should be evaluated within the interactive notebook paradigm rather than through traditional software executability standards.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables, the 22nd International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR 2025)</p></details> |

We present a lightweight framework that instruction-tuned large language model (LLM) with LoRA adapters and uses candidate-constrained decoding to ensure valid assignments. Tested on EclipseJDT and Mozilla datasets, the model achieves strong shortlist quality (Hit at 10 up to 0.753) despite modest exact Top-1 accuracy. On recent snapshots, accuracy rises sharply, showing the framework's potential for real-world, human-in-the-loop triaging. Our results suggest that instruction-tuned LLMs offer a practical alternative to costly feature engineering and graph-based methods.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |

| **[Characterizing Trust Boundary Vulnerabilities in TEE Containers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20962v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) have emerged as a cornerstone of confidential computing, garnering significant attention from both academia and industry. To enable the secure development, execution, and deployment, of applications on TEE platforms, TEE containers have been introduced as middleware solutions. These containers aim to shield applications from potentially malicious operating systems and orchestration interfaces while maintaining usability and reliability. In this paper, we analyze the isolation strategies employed by existing TEE containers to protect secure applications. To address the challenges in analyzing these interfaces, we designed an automated analyzer to precisely identify and evaluate their isolation boundaries. We observed that some TEE containers fail to achieve their intended goals due to critical design and implementation flaws, such as information leakage, rollback attacks, denial-of-service, and Iago attacks, which pose significant security risks. Drawing from our findings, we share key lessons to guide the development of more secure container solutions and discuss emerging trends in TEE containerization design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning Based Concurrency Bug Detection and Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20911v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concurrency bugs, caused by improper synchronization of shared resources in multi-threaded or distributed systems, are notoriously hard to detect and thus compromise software reliability and security. The existing deep learning methods face three main limitations. First, there is an absence of large and dedicated datasets of diverse concurrency bugs for them. Second, they lack sufficient representation of concurrency semantics. Third, binary classification results fail to provide finer-grained debug information such as precise bug lines. To address these problems, we propose a novel method for effective concurrency bug detection as well as localization. We construct a dedicated concurrency bug dataset to facilitate model training and evaluation. We then integrate a pre-trained model with a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN), by incorporating a new Concurrency-Aware Code Property Graph (CCPG) that concisely and effectively characterizes concurrency semantics. To further facilitate debugging, we employ SubgraphX, a GNN-based interpretability method, which explores the graphs to precisely localize concurrency bugs, mapping them to specific lines of source code. On average, our method demonstrates an improvement of 10\% in accuracy and precision and 26\% in recall compared to state-of-the-art methods across diverse evaluation settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Test Oracles for Flaky Cyber-Physical System Simulators: Approach and Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20902v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulation-based testing of cyber-physical systems (CPS) is costly due to the time-consuming execution of CPS simulators. In addition, CPS simulators may be flaky, leading to inconsistent test outcomes and requiring repeated test re-execution for reliable test verdicts. Automated test oracles that do not require system execution are therefore crucial for reducing testing costs. Ideally, such test oracles should be interpretable to facilitate human understanding of test verdicts, and they must be robust against the potential flakiness of CPS simulators. In this article, we propose assertion-based test oracles for CPS as sets of logical and arithmetic predicates defined over the inputs of the system under test. Given a test input, our assertion-based test oracle determines, without requiring test execution, whether the test passes, fails, or if the oracle is inconclusive in predicting a verdict. We describe two methods for generating assertion-based test oracles: one using genetic programming~(GP) that employs well-known spectrum-based fault localization (SBFL) ranking formulas, namely Ochiai, Tarantula, and Naish, as fitness functions; and the other using decision trees (DT) and decision rules (DR). We evaluate our assertion-based test oracles through case studies in the domains of aerospace, networking and autonomous driving. We show that test oracles generated using GP with Ochiai are significantly more accurate than those obtained using GP with Tarantula and Naish or using DT or DR. Moreover, this accuracy advantage remains even when accounting for the flakiness of the system under test. We further show that the assertion-based test oracles generated by GP with Ochiai are robust against flakiness with only 4% average variation in their accuracy results across four different network and autonomous driving systems with flaky behaviours.</p></details> |  |

Given the challenges in writing comprehensive unit tests, LLMs have been employed to automate test generation, yet methods for training LLMs to produce high-quality tests remain underexplored. In this work, we propose UTRL, a novel reinforcement learning framework that trains an LLM to generate high-quality unit tests given a programming instruction. Our key idea is to iteratively train two LLMs, the unit test generator and the code generator, in an adversarial manner via reinforcement learning. The unit test generator is trained to maximize a discrimination reward, which reflects its ability to produce tests that expose faults in the code generator's solutions, and the code generator is trained to maximize a code reward, which reflects its ability to produce solutions that pass the unit tests generated by the test generator. In our experiments, we demonstrate that unit tests generated by Qwen3-4B trained via UTRL show higher quality compared to unit tests generated by the same model trained via supervised fine-tuning on human-written ground-truth unit tests, yielding code evaluations that more closely align with those induced by the ground-truth tests. Moreover, Qwen3-4B trained with UTRL outperforms frontier models such as GPT-4.1 in generating high-quality unit tests, highlighting the effectiveness of UTRL in training LLMs for this task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at: https://github.com/dgjun32/UTRL</p></details> |

Tools such as model-checkers and theorem provers ensure software correctness by verifying the implementation against the specification. Formal methods deployment is regularly enforced in the development of safety-critical systems e.g. aerospace, medical devices and autonomous systems. Generating these specifications from informal and ambiguous natural language requirements remains the key challenge. Our project, VERIFAI^{1}, aims to investigate automated and semi-automated approaches to bridge this gap, using techniques from Natural Language Processing (NLP), ontology-based domain modelling, artefact reuse, and large language models (LLMs).

| **[Towards an Architectural Perspective for Sustainability: Bundle the Needs from Industry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20774v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sustainability is increasingly recognized as an emerging quality property in software-intensive systems, yet architects lack structured guidance to address it effectively throughout the software design phase. Architectural perspectives-an architectural knowledge artifact composed of concerns, activities, tactics, pitfalls, and checklists-offer a promising approach to tackle such emerging quality properties across architectural views and are also independent of architecture frameworks and industry contexts. In this paper, we present a sustainability perspective vision, i.e., a revised notion of architectural perspective meant to be filled with its own elements to target sustainability concerns. We formulate our sustainability perspective vision through evidence from applying snowballing to seminal literature and from conducting a focus group with experts in the field. Our findings confirm the relevance of the different perspective elements in practice and highlight implications for shaping a sustainability perspective that meets industrial needs.</p></details> |  |

While these tools streamline development, they also introduce subtle risks to the software supply chain. In this paper, we present Maven-Hijack, a novel attack that exploits the order in which Maven packages dependencies and the way the Java Virtual Machine resolves classes at runtime. By injecting a malicious class with the same fully qualified name as a legitimate one into a dependency that is packaged earlier, an attacker can silently override core application behavior without modifying the main codebase or library names. We demonstrate the real-world feasibility of this attack by compromising the Corona-Warn-App, a widely used open-source COVID-19 contact tracing system, and gaining control over its database connection logic. We evaluate three mitigation strategies, such as sealed JARs, Java Modules, and the Maven Enforcer plugin. Our results show that, while Java Modules offer strong protection, the Maven Enforcer plugin with duplicate class detection provides the most practical and effective defense for current Java projects. These findings highlight the urgent need for improved safeguards in Java's build and dependency management processes to prevent stealthy supply chain attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, added a mitigation chapter</p></details> |
| **[A Joint Learning Framework for Bridging Defect Prediction and Interpretation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16429v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past fifty years, numerous software defect prediction (SDP) approaches have been proposed. However, the ability to explain why predictors make certain predictions remains limited. Explainable SDP has emerged as a promising solution by using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods to clarify the decision-making processes of predictors. Despite this progress, there is still significant potential to enhance the reliability of existing approaches. To address this limitation, we treat defect prediction and the corresponding interpretation as two distinct but closely related tasks and propose a joint learning framework that allows for the simultaneous training of the predictor and its interpreter. The novelty of our approach lies in two main aspects: 1. We design feedback loops that convey the decision-making logic from the predictor to the interpreter. This ensures a high level of conciseness in decision logic and feature engineering for both the predictor and the interpreter, enabling the interpreter to achieve reliable local and global interpretability. 2. We incorporate the interpretation results as a penalty term in the loss function of the joint-learning framework. This not only improves the accuracy of the predictor but also imposes a stronger constraint on the reliability of the interpreter. We validated our proposed method against several existing explainable SDPs across multiple datasets. The results demonstrate its effectiveness in both interpretation and defect prediction. The source code for the proposed method is available at: https://github.com/BugPredictor/software-defect-prediction.git</p></details> |  |
| **[From Law to Gherkin: A Human-Centred Quasi-Experiment on the Quality of LLM-Generated Behavioural Specifications from Food-Safety Regulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20744v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Laws and regulations increasingly affect software design and quality assurance, but legal texts are written in technology-neutral language. This creates challenges for engineers who must develop compliance artifacts such as requirements and acceptance criteria. Manual creation is labor-intensive, error-prone, and requires domain expertise. Advances in Generative AI (GenAI), especially Large Language Models (LLMs), offer a way to automate deriving such artifacts. Objective: We present the first systematic human-subject study of LLMs' ability to derive behavioral specifications from legal texts using a quasi-experimental design. These specifications translate legal requirements into a developer-friendly form. Methods: Ten participants evaluated specifications generated from food-safety regulations by Claude and Llama. Using Gherkin, a structured BDD language, 60 specifications were produced. Each participant assessed 12 across five criteria: Relevance, Clarity, Completeness, Singularity, and Time Savings. Each specification was reviewed by two participants, yielding 120 assessments. Results: For Relevance, 75% of ratings were highest and 20% second-highest. Clarity reached 90% highest. Completeness: 75% highest, 19% second. Singularity: 82% highest, 12% second. Time Savings: 68% highest, 24% second. No lowest ratings occurred. Mann-Whitney U tests showed no significant differences across participants or models. Llama slightly outperformed Claude in Clarity, Completeness, and Time Savings, while Claude was stronger in Singularity. Feedback noted hallucinations and omissions but confirmed the utility of the specifications. Conclusion: LLMs can generate high-quality Gherkin specifications from legal texts, reducing manual effort and providing structured artifacts useful for implementation, assurance, and test generation.</p></details> |  |

Their inherent non-determinism, dynamism, and context dependence pose fundamental challenges for quality assurance. This paper decomposes LLM applications into a three-layer architecture: \textbf{\textit{System Shell Layer}}, \textbf{\textit{Prompt Orchestration Layer}}, and \textbf{\textit{LLM Inference Core}}. We then assess the applicability of traditional software testing methods in each layer: directly applicable at the shell layer, requiring semantic reinterpretation at the orchestration layer, and necessitating paradigm shifts at the inference core. A comparative analysis of Testing AI methods from the software engineering community and safety analysis techniques from the AI community reveals structural disconnects in testing unit abstraction, evaluation metrics, and lifecycle management. We identify four fundamental differences that underlie 6 core challenges. To address these, we propose four types of collaborative strategies (\emph{Retain}, \emph{Translate}, \emph{Integrate}, and \emph{Runtime}) and explore a closed-loop, trustworthy quality assurance framework that combines pre-deployment validation with runtime monitoring. Based on these strategies, we offer practical guidance and a protocol proposal to support the standardization and tooling of LLM application testing. We propose a protocol \textbf{\textit{Agent Interaction Communication Language}} (AICL) that is used to communicate between AI agents. AICL has the test-oriented features and is easily integrated in the current agent framework.</p></details> |  |

Data types such as bioimages, experimental records, and spectral information are often maintained in separate repositories, each following different management standards. However, linking these data sources across the research lifecycle is essential to align with the FAIR principles of data management: Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability. Despite this need, there is a notable lack of tools capable of effectively integrating and linking data from heterogeneous sources. To address this gap, we present LEO (Linking Electronic Lab Notebooks with OMERO), a web-based platform designed to create and manage links between distributed data systems. LEO was initially developed to link objects between Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELNs) and OMERO, but its functionality has since been extended through a plugin-based architecture, allowing the integration of additional data sources. This extensibility makes LEO a scalable and flexible solution for a wide range of microscopy research workflows.</p></details> |  |

The workshop brought together over 30 interdisciplinary academic researchers and industry practitioners to tackle the concrete challenges and emerging opportunities at the intersection of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and agile software development. Through structured, interactive breakout sessions, participants identified shared pain points like tool fragmentation, governance, data quality, and critical skills gaps in AI literacy and prompt engineering. These issues were further analyzed, revealing underlying causes and cross-cutting concerns. The workshop concluded by collaboratively co-creating a multi-thematic research roadmap, articulating both short-term, implementable actions and visionary, long-term research directions. This cohesive agenda aims to guide future investigation and drive the responsible, human-centered integration of GenAI into agile practices.</p></details> |  |

However, current LLM API-using methods struggle with complex API coupling commonly encountered in academic queries. To address this, we introduce SoAy, a solution-based LLM API-using methodology for academic information seeking. It uses code with a solution as the reasoning method, where a solution is a pre-constructed API calling sequence. The addition of the solution reduces the difficulty for the model to understand the complex relationships between APIs. Code improves the efficiency of reasoning. To evaluate SoAy, we introduce SoAyBench, an evaluation benchmark accompanied by SoAyEval, built upon a cloned environment of APIs from AMiner. Experimental results demonstrate a 34.58-75.99\% performance improvement compared to state-of-the-art LLM API-based baselines.

Countries such as Bhutan have already implemented an SSI infrastructure to manage the identity of their citizens. The EU, thanks to the revised eIDAS regulation, is opening the door for SSI vendors to develop SSI systems for the planned EU digital identity wallet. These developments, which fall within the sovereign domain, raise questions about individual privacy. The design of SSI systems is complex, often characterized by a large number of components and architectural choices because the current SSI communities differ on how to create identifiers, how to build and present credentials, and even how to design a user wallet. SSI stacks developed by different organizations provide different privacy features for different privacy needs. This paper performs a systematic mapping and review of SSI components and technologies into a novel four-layer privacy framework to address the design complexity of SSI systems. Based on this review, we provide an accompanying Design Assistance Dashboard (DAD). The DAD shows the interdependencies between SSI components in different layers, and maps these components to different privacy requirements and considerations, even providing a simple privacy class for each component.</p></details> |  |

At the same time, their security has increasingly been acknowledged as a problem. To this end, the paper examines the previously overlooked longitudinal aspects of software ecosystem security, focusing on malware uploaded to six popular programming language ecosystems. The dataset examined is based on the new Open Source Vulnerabilities (OSV) database. According to the results, records about detected malware uploads in the database have recently surpassed those addressing vulnerabilities in packages distributed in the ecosystems. In the early 2025 even up to 80% of all entries in the OSV have been about malware. Regarding time series analysis of malware frequencies and their shares to all database entries, good predictions are available already by relatively simple autoregressive models using the numbers of ecosystems, security advisories, and media and other articles as predictors. With these results and the accompanying discussion, the paper improves and advances the understanding of the thus far overlooked longitudinal aspects of ecosystems and malware.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security (ARES 2025), Ghent, Springer, pp. 269-285.

| **[Adaptive Root Cause Localization for Microservice Systems with Multi-Agent Recursion-of-Thought](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20370v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As contemporary microservice systems become increasingly popular and complex-often comprising hundreds or even thousands of fine-grained, interdependent subsystems-they are facing more frequent failures. Ensuring system reliability thus demands accurate root cause localization. While traces and metrics have proven to be effective data sources for this task, existing methods either heavily rely on pre-defined schemas, which struggle to adapt to evolving operational contexts, or lack interpretability in their reasoning process, thereby leaving Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) confused. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on how SREs localize the root cause of failures, drawing insights from multiple professional SREs across different organizations. Our investigation reveals that human root cause analysis exhibits three key characteristics: recursiveness, multi-dimensional expansion, and cross-modal reasoning. Motivated by these findings, we introduce RCLAgent, an adaptive root cause localization method for microservice systems that leverages a multi-agent recursion-of-thought framework. RCLAgent employs a novel recursion-of-thought strategy to guide the LLM's reasoning process, effectively integrating data from multiple agents and tool-assisted analysis to accurately pinpoint the root cause. Experimental evaluations on various public datasets demonstrate that RCLAgent achieves superior performance by localizing the root cause using only a single request-outperforming state-of-the-art methods that depend on aggregating multiple requests. These results underscore the effectiveness of RCLAgent in enhancing the efficiency and precision of root cause localization in complex microservice environments.</p></details> |  |

The focus is on quantum and hybrid quantum-classical software systems, where model-driven approaches can help reduce the costs and mitigate the risks associated with the heterogeneous platform landscape and lack of developers' skills. We validate one of the proposed ideas regarding generating code out of UML model instances of software systems. This Python code uses a well-established library, called Qiskit, to execute on gate-based or circuit-based quantum computers. The RAG pipeline that we deploy incorporates sample Qiskit code from public GitHub repositories. Experimental results show that well-engineered prompts can improve CodeBLEU scores by up to a factor of four, yielding more accurate and consistent quantum code. However, the proposed research direction can go beyond this through further investigation in the future by conducting experiments to address our other research questions and ideas proposed here, such as deploying software system model instances as the source of information in the RAG pipelines, or deploying LLMs for code-to-code transformations, for instance, for transpilation use cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted to the New Ideas and Emerging Results (NIER) track of the ACM/IEEE 28th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems (MODELS)</p></details> |
| **[Boosting Skeleton-Driven SMT Solver Fuzzing by Leveraging LLM to Produce Formula Generators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20340v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solvers are foundational to modern systems and programming languages research, providing the foundation for tasks like symbolic execution and automated verification. Because these solvers sit on the critical path, their correctness is essential, and high-quality test formulas are key to uncovering bugs. However, while prior testing techniques performed well on earlier solver versions, they struggle to keep pace with rapidly evolving features. Recent approaches based on Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in exploring advanced solver capabilities, but two obstacles remain: nearly half of the generated formulas are syntactically invalid, and iterative interactions with the LLMs introduce substantial computational overhead. In this study, we present Chimera, a novel LLM-assisted fuzzing framework that addresses both issues by shifting from direct formula generation to the synthesis of reusable term (i.e., logical expression) generators. Particularly, Chimera uses LLMs to (1) automatically extract context-free grammars (CFGs) for SMT theories, including solver-specific extensions, from documentation, and (2) synthesize composable Boolean term generators that adhere to these grammars. During fuzzing, Chimera populates structural skeletons derived from existing formulas with the terms iteratively produced by the LLM-synthesized generators. This design ensures syntactic validity while promoting semantic diversity. Notably, Chimera requires only one-time LLM interaction investment, dramatically reducing runtime cost. We evaluated Chimera on two leading SMT solvers: Z3 and cvc5. Our experiments show that Chimera has identified 43 confirmed bugs, 40 of which have already been fixed by developers.</p></details> |  |

While the analysis of real-world programs remains a theoretical challenge, the automation of loop invariant analysis has effectively resolved the problem. However, real-world programs that often mix complex data structures and control flows pose challenges to traditional loop invariant generation tools. To enhance the applicability of invariant generation techniques, we proposed ACInv, an Automated Complex program loop Invariant generation tool, which combines static analysis with Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate the proper loop invariants. We utilize static analysis to extract the necessary information for each loop and embed it into prompts for the LLM to generate invariants for each loop. Subsequently, we employ an LLM-based evaluator to assess the generated invariants, refining them by either strengthening, weakening, or rejecting them based on their correctness, ultimately obtaining enhanced invariants. We conducted experiments on ACInv, which showed that ACInv outperformed previous tools on data sets with data structures, and maintained similar performance to the state-of-the-art tool AutoSpec on numerical programs without data structures. For the total data set, ACInv can solve 21% more examples than AutoSpec and can generate reference data structure templates.</p></details> | 26 pages, 11 figures |

However, LLMs are prone to hallucination-outputs that stray from intended meanings. Detecting hallucinations in code summarization is especially difficult due to the complex interplay between programming and natural languages. We introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset with $\sim$10K samples, curated specifically for hallucination detection in code summarization. We further propose a novel Entity Tracing Framework (ETF) that a) utilizes static program analysis to identify code entities from the program and b) uses LLMs to map and verify these entities and their intents within generated code summaries. Our experimental analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the framework, leading to a 0.73 F1 score. This approach provides an interpretable method for detecting hallucinations by grounding entities, allowing us to evaluate summary accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |

However, efforts to quantify and track this progress have suffered due to a lack of reliable metrics for functional correctness. While popular benchmarks like HumanEval have test cases to enable reliable evaluation of correctness, it is time-consuming and requires human effort to collect test cases. As an alternative several reference-based evaluation metrics have been proposed, with embedding-based metrics like CodeBERTScore being touted as having a high correlation with human preferences and functional correctness. In our work, we analyze the ability of embedding-based metrics like CodeBERTScore to measure functional correctness and other helpful constructs like editing effort by analyzing outputs of ten models over two popular code generation benchmarks. Our results show that while they have a weak correlation with functional correctness (0.16), they are strongly correlated (0.72) with editing effort.</p></details> |  |

Thanks to the rapid development of pre-training techniques, surging large language models are being proposed for code, sparking the advances in NL2Code. To facilitate further research and applications in this field, in this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of 27 existing large language models for NL2Code, and also review benchmarks and metrics. We provide an intuitive comparison of all existing models on the HumanEval benchmark. Through in-depth observation and analysis, we provide some insights and conclude that the key factors contributing to the success of large language models for NL2Code are "Large Size, Premium Data, Expert Tuning". In addition, we discuss challenges and opportunities regarding the gap between models and humans. We also create a website https://nl2code.github.io to track the latest progress through crowd-sourcing.

Agile methodologies are replacing traditional approaches such as Waterfall, where flexibility, iterative development and adaptation to change are favoured over rigid planning and execution. DevOps, a subsequent evolution from Agile, emphasises collaborative efforts in development and operations teams, focusing on continuous integration and deployment to deliver resilient and high-quality software products and services. This study aims to critically assess both Agile and DevOps practices in the IT industry to identify the feasibility and applicability of Agile methods in DevOps practices. Eleven semi-structured interviews were conducted with Agile and DevOps practitioners in varying capacities across several sectors within the IT industry. Through thematic analysis, 51 unique codes were extracted and synthesised into 19 themes that reported on each phase of the DevOps lifecycle, specifically regarding the integration and implementation of Agile methods into DevOps practices. Based on the findings, a new understanding detailing the interrelationship of Agile methods in DevOps practices was discussed that met the research objectives.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 2 figures, conference</p></details> |

Existing approaches -- ownership systems, linear and affine types, uniqueness types, and lexical effect tracking -- impose global restrictions such as uniqueness or linearity, or rely on shallow syntactic analyses. These designs fall short with higher-order functions and shared mutable state. Reachability Types (RT) track aliasing and separation in higher-order programs, ensuring runtime safety and non-interference. However, RT systems face three key limitations: (1) they prohibit cyclic references, ruling out non-terminating computations and fixed-point combinators; (2) they require deep tracking, where a qualifier must include all transitively reachable locations, reducing precision and hindering optimizations like fine-grained parallelism; and (3) referent qualifier invariance prevents referents from escaping their allocation contexts, making reference factories inexpressible. In this work, we address these limitations by extending RT with three mechanisms that enhance expressiveness. First, we introduce cyclic references, enabling recursive patterns to be encoded directly through the store. Second, we adopt shallow qualifier tracking, decoupling references from their transitively reachable values. Finally, we introduce an escaping rule with reference subtyping, allowing referent qualifiers to outlive their allocation context. These extensions are formalized in the $\mathsf{F}_{<:}^{\circ}$-calculus with a mechanized proof of type soundness, and case studies illustrate expressiveness through fixpoint combinators, non-interfering parallelism, and escaping read-only references.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting Stealthy Data Poisoning Attacks in AI Code Generators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21636v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning (DL) models for natural language-to-code generation have become integral to modern software development pipelines. However, their heavy reliance on large amounts of data, often collected from unsanitized online sources, exposes them to data poisoning attacks, where adversaries inject malicious samples to subtly bias model behavior. Recent targeted attacks silently replace secure code with semantically equivalent but vulnerable implementations without relying on explicit triggers to launch the attack, making it especially hard for detection methods to distinguish clean from poisoned samples. We present a systematic study on the effectiveness of existing poisoning detection methods under this stealthy threat model. Specifically, we perform targeted poisoning on three DL models (CodeBERT, CodeT5+, AST-T5), and evaluate spectral signatures analysis, activation clustering, and static analysis as defenses. Our results show that all methods struggle to detect triggerless poisoning, with representation-based approaches failing to isolate poisoned samples and static analysis suffering false positives and false negatives, highlighting the need for more robust, trigger-independent defenses for AI-assisted code generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 3rd IEEE International Workshop on Reliable and Secure AI for Software Engineering (ReSAISE, 2025), co-located with ISSRE 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we present a large-scale comparison of code authored by human developers and three state-of-the-art LLMs, i.e., ChatGPT, DeepSeek-Coder, and Qwen-Coder, on multiple dimensions of software quality: code defects, security vulnerabilities, and structural complexity. Our evaluation spans over 500k code samples in two widely used languages, Python and Java, classifying defects via Orthogonal Defect Classification and security vulnerabilities using the Common Weakness Enumeration. We find that AI-generated code is generally simpler and more repetitive, yet more prone to unused constructs and hardcoded debugging, while human-written code exhibits greater structural complexity and a higher concentration of maintainability issues. Notably, AI-generated code also contains more high-risk security vulnerabilities. These findings highlight the distinct defect profiles of AI- and human-authored code and underscore the need for specialized quality assurance practices in AI-assisted programming.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 36th IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE, 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Semantic Understanding in Pointer Analysis using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21454v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pointer analysis has been studied for over four decades. However, existing frameworks continue to suffer from the propagation of incorrect facts. A major limitation stems from their insufficient semantic understanding of code, resulting in overly conservative treatment of user-defined functions. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) present new opportunities to bridge this gap. In this paper, we propose LMPA (LLM-enhanced Pointer Analysis), a vision that integrates LLMs into pointer analysis to enhance both precision and scalability. LMPA identifies user-defined functions that resemble system APIs and models them accordingly, thereby mitigating erroneous cross-calling-context propagation. Furthermore, it enhances summary-based analysis by inferring initial points-to sets and introducing a novel summary strategy augmented with natural language. Finally, we discuss the key challenges involved in realizing this vision.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by LMPL 2025</p></details> |
| **[The Complexity Trap: Simple Observation Masking Is as Efficient as LLM Summarization for Agent Context Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21433v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents solve complex tasks through iterative reasoning, exploration, and tool-use, a process that can result in long, expensive context histories. While state-of-the-art Software Engineering ( SE) agents like OpenHands or Cursor use LLM-based summarization to tackle this issue, it is unclear whether the increased complexity offers tangible performance benefits compared to simply omitting older observations. We present a systematic comparison of these strategies within SWE-agent on SWE-bench Verified across five diverse model configurations. We find that a simple observation-masking strategy halves cost relative to a raw agent while matching, and sometimes slightly exceeding, the solve rate of LLM summarization. For example, with Qwen3-Coder 480B, masking improves solve rate from 53.8% (raw agent) to 54.8%, while remaining competitive with summarization at a lower cost. These results suggest that, at least within SWE-agent on SWE-bench Verified, the most effective and efficient context management can be the simplest. We release code and data for reproducibility</p></details> |  |
| **[RepoMark: A Code Usage Auditing Framework for Code Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21432v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation has transformed software development by automating coding tasks with unprecedented efficiency. However, the training of these models on open-source code repositories (e.g., from GitHub) raises critical ethical and legal concerns, particularly regarding data authorization and open-source license compliance. Developers are increasingly questioning whether model trainers have obtained proper authorization before using repositories for training, especially given the lack of transparency in data collection. To address these concerns, we propose a novel data marking framework RepoMark to audit the data usage of code LLMs. Our method enables repository owners to verify whether their code has been used in training, while ensuring semantic preservation, imperceptibility, and theoretical false detection rate (FDR) guarantees. By generating multiple semantically equivalent code variants, RepoMark introduces data marks into the code files, and during detection, RepoMark leverages a novel ranking-based hypothesis test to detect memorization within the model. Compared to prior data auditing approaches, RepoMark significantly enhances sample efficiency, allowing effective auditing even when the user's repository possesses only a small number of code files. Experiments demonstrate that RepoMark achieves a detection success rate over 90\% on small code repositories under a strict FDR guarantee of 5\%. This represents a significant advancement over existing data marking techniques, all of which only achieve accuracy below 55\% under identical settings. This further validates RepoMark as a robust, theoretically sound, and promising solution for enhancing transparency in code LLM training, which can safeguard the rights of repository owners.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Study of Vulnerable Package Dependencies in LLM Repositories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21417v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have developed rapidly in recent years, revolutionizing various fields. Despite their widespread success, LLMs heavily rely on external code dependencies from package management systems, creating a complex and interconnected LLM dependency supply chain. Vulnerabilities in dependencies can expose LLMs to security risks. While existing research predominantly focuses on model-level security threats, vulnerabilities within the LLM dependency supply chain have been overlooked. To fill this gap, we conducted an empirical analysis of 52 open-source LLMs, examining their third-party dependencies and associated vulnerabilities. We then explored activities within the LLM repositories to understand how maintainers manage third-party vulnerabilities in practice. Finally, we compared third-party dependency vulnerabilities in the LLM ecosystem to those in the Python ecosystem. Our results show that half of the vulnerabilities in the LLM ecosystem remain undisclosed for more than 56.2 months, significantly longer than those in the Python ecosystem. Additionally, 75.8% of LLMs include vulnerable dependencies in their configuration files. This study advances the understanding of LLM supply chain risks, provides insights for practitioners, and highlights potential directions for improving the security of the LLM supply chain.</p></details> |  |

Bad practices of code comments lead to code comment smells, negatively impacting software maintenance. Recent research has been conducted on classifying inline code comment smells, yet automatically detecting these still remains a challenge. We aim to automatically detect and classify inline code comment smells through machine learning (ML) models and a large language model (LLM) to determine how accurately each smell type can be detected. We enhanced a previously labeled dataset, where comments are labeled according to a determined taxonomy, by augmenting it with additional code segments and their associated comments. GPT 4, a large language model, was used to classify code comment smells on both the original and augmented datasets to evaluate its performance. In parallel, we trained and tested seven different machine learning algorithms on the augmented dataset to compare their classification performance against GPT 4. The performance of models, particularly Random Forest, which achieved an overall accuracy of 69 percent, along with Gradient Boosting and Logistic Regression, each achieving 66 percent and 65 percent, respectively, establishes a solid baseline for future research in this domain. The Random Forest model outperformed all other ML models, by achieving the highest Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) score of 0.44. The augmented dataset improved the overall classification accuracy of the GPT 4 model predictions from 34 percent to 55 percent. This study contributes to software maintainability by exploring the automatic detection and classification of inline code comment smells. We have made our augmented dataset and code artifacts available online, offering a valuable resource for developing automated comment smell detection tools.</p></details> |  |

Existing diagnosability supports focus on post-failure analysis of software behavior to identify configuration issues, but none of these approaches look into whether the software clue sufficient failure information for diagnosis. To fill in the blank, we propose the idea of configuration logging to enhance existing logging practices at the source code level. We develop ConfLogger, the first tool that unifies configuration-aware static taint analysis with LLM-based log generation to enhance software configuration diagnosability. Specifically, our method 1) identifies configuration-sensitive code segments by tracing configuration-related data flow in the whole project, and 2) generates diagnostic log statements by analyzing configuration code contexts. Evaluation results on eight popular software systems demonstrate the effectiveness of ConfLogger to enhance configuration diagnosability. Specifically, ConfLogger-enhanced logs successfully aid a log-based misconfiguration diagnosis tool to achieve 100% accuracy on error localization in 30 silent misconfiguration scenarios, with 80% directly resolvable through explicit configuration information exposed. In addition, ConfLogger achieves 74% coverage of existing logging points, outperforming baseline LLM-based loggers by 12% and 30%. It also gains 8.6% higher in precision, 79.3% higher in recall, and 26.2% higher in F1 compared to the state-of-the-art baseline in terms of variable logging while also augmenting diagnostic value. A controlled user study on 22 cases further validated its utility, speeding up diagnostic time by 1.25x and improving troubleshooting accuracy by 251.4%.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, accepted by ICSE '26 (The 48th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering)</p></details> |

Yet, many papers do not meet such requirements. The uniqueness of HPC infrastructure and software, coupled with strict access requirements, may limit opportunities for reproducibility. In the absence of resource access, we believe that regular documented testing, through continuous integration (CI), coupled with complete provenance information, can be used as a substitute. Here, we argue that better HPC-compliant CI solutions will improve reproducibility of applications. We present a survey of reproducibility initiatives and describe the barriers to reproducibility in HPC. To address existing limitations, we present a GitHub Action, CORRECT, that enables secure execution of tests on remote HPC resources. We evaluate CORRECT's usability across three different types of HPC applications, demonstrating the effectiveness of using CORRECT for automating and documenting reproducibility evaluations.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM as an Execution Estimator: Recovering Missing Dependency for Practical Time-travelling Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18721v4)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose RecovSlicing for computing dynamic data dependency in a single run, with only partial instrumentation. We explore the intuition that LLM can potentially infer program dynamics based on a partially recorded trace and relevant code as its context. Given (1) a partially recorded trace of a program $P$ and (2) the slicing criteria consisting of a query step $s$ and a query variable $v$ read by $s$, RecovSlicing computes the runtime definition of $v$ on the trace by estimating the miss-recorded execution of $P$. In this work, we allow the user to specify implicit query variable, for example, the implicit library variable used in list{\ttfamily .}get(i). Technically, built upon non-deterministic LLM, we address the challenges of (1) precise recovery of runtime variable value and structure from the recorded execution and (2) aligning the memory address of recovered variables and the recorded variables for definition analysis. We extensively evaluate RecovSlicing against the state-of-the-art slicers such as Slicer4J, ND-Slicer, LLM Slicer, and re-execution Slicer on a total number of 8300 data-dependencies over 3 slicing benchmarks. The results show that RecovSlicing can significantly outperform the baselines. The accuracy and recall, achieving 80.3%, 91.1%, and 98.3% on the three benchmarks, whereas the best baseline reaches 39.0%, 82.0%, and 59.9% (accuracy), and 53.4%, 79.1%, and 87.1% (recall), respectively. In addition, we integrate RecovSlicing in a dual-slicing based regression bug localizer, significantly improving its performance by locating 16% more regressions.</p></details> |  |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have made strides in code generation, they struggle to achieve high branch coverage due to their limited ability to reason about intricate control flow structures. To address this limitation, we introduce Panta, a technique that emulates the iterative process human developers follow when analyzing code and constructing test cases. Panta integrates static control flow analysis and dynamic code coverage analysis to systematically guide LLMs in identifying uncovered execution paths and generating better test cases. By incorporating an iterative feedback-driven mechanism, our technique continuously refines test generation based on static and dynamic path coverage insights, ensuring more comprehensive and effective testing. Our empirical evaluation, conducted on classes with high cyclomatic complexity from open-source projects, demonstrates that Panta achieves 26% higher line coverage and 23% higher branch coverage compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in 2026 IEEE/ACM 48th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2026)</p></details> |

However, this flexibility often introduces code quality issues, with prior studies showing that approximately 76% of public notebooks are non-executable, raising significant concerns about reusability. We argue that the traditional notion of executability - requiring a notebook to run fully and without error - is overly rigid, misclassifying many notebooks and overestimating their non-executability. This paper investigates pathological executability issues in public notebooks under varying notions and degrees of executability. Even partially improving executability can improve code comprehension and offer a pathway for dynamic analyses. With this insight, we first categorize notebooks into potentially restorable and pathological non-executable notebooks and then measure how removing misconfiguration and superficial execution issues in notebooks can improve their executability (i.e., additional cells executed without error). In a dataset of 42,546 popular public notebooks containing 34,659 non-executable notebooks, only 21.3% are truly pathologically non-executable. For restorable notebooks, LLM-based methods fully restore 5.4% of previously non-executable notebooks. Among the partially restored, the executability of notebooks improves by 42.7% and 28% by installing the correct modules and generating synthetic data. These findings challenge prior assumptions, suggesting that notebooks have higher executability than previously reported, many of which offer valuable partial execution, and that their executability should be evaluated within the interactive notebook paradigm rather than through traditional software executability standards.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables, the 22nd International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Deep Learning Based Concurrency Bug Detection and Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20911v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concurrency bugs, caused by improper synchronization of shared resources in multi-threaded or distributed systems, are notoriously hard to detect and thus compromise software reliability and security. The existing deep learning methods face three main limitations. First, there is an absence of large and dedicated datasets of diverse concurrency bugs for them. Second, they lack sufficient representation of concurrency semantics. Third, binary classification results fail to provide finer-grained debug information such as precise bug lines. To address these problems, we propose a novel method for effective concurrency bug detection as well as localization. We construct a dedicated concurrency bug dataset to facilitate model training and evaluation. We then integrate a pre-trained model with a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN), by incorporating a new Concurrency-Aware Code Property Graph (CCPG) that concisely and effectively characterizes concurrency semantics. To further facilitate debugging, we employ SubgraphX, a GNN-based interpretability method, which explores the graphs to precisely localize concurrency bugs, mapping them to specific lines of source code. On average, our method demonstrates an improvement of 10\% in accuracy and precision and 26\% in recall compared to state-of-the-art methods across diverse evaluation settings.</p></details> |  |

Given the challenges in writing comprehensive unit tests, LLMs have been employed to automate test generation, yet methods for training LLMs to produce high-quality tests remain underexplored. In this work, we propose UTRL, a novel reinforcement learning framework that trains an LLM to generate high-quality unit tests given a programming instruction. Our key idea is to iteratively train two LLMs, the unit test generator and the code generator, in an adversarial manner via reinforcement learning. The unit test generator is trained to maximize a discrimination reward, which reflects its ability to produce tests that expose faults in the code generator's solutions, and the code generator is trained to maximize a code reward, which reflects its ability to produce solutions that pass the unit tests generated by the test generator. In our experiments, we demonstrate that unit tests generated by Qwen3-4B trained via UTRL show higher quality compared to unit tests generated by the same model trained via supervised fine-tuning on human-written ground-truth unit tests, yielding code evaluations that more closely align with those induced by the ground-truth tests. Moreover, Qwen3-4B trained with UTRL outperforms frontier models such as GPT-4.1 in generating high-quality unit tests, highlighting the effectiveness of UTRL in training LLMs for this task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at: https://github.com/dgjun32/UTRL</p></details> |
| **[A Joint Learning Framework for Bridging Defect Prediction and Interpretation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16429v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past fifty years, numerous software defect prediction (SDP) approaches have been proposed. However, the ability to explain why predictors make certain predictions remains limited. Explainable SDP has emerged as a promising solution by using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods to clarify the decision-making processes of predictors. Despite this progress, there is still significant potential to enhance the reliability of existing approaches. To address this limitation, we treat defect prediction and the corresponding interpretation as two distinct but closely related tasks and propose a joint learning framework that allows for the simultaneous training of the predictor and its interpreter. The novelty of our approach lies in two main aspects: 1. We design feedback loops that convey the decision-making logic from the predictor to the interpreter. This ensures a high level of conciseness in decision logic and feature engineering for both the predictor and the interpreter, enabling the interpreter to achieve reliable local and global interpretability. 2. We incorporate the interpretation results as a penalty term in the loss function of the joint-learning framework. This not only improves the accuracy of the predictor but also imposes a stronger constraint on the reliability of the interpreter. We validated our proposed method against several existing explainable SDPs across multiple datasets. The results demonstrate its effectiveness in both interpretation and defect prediction.

| **[From Law to Gherkin: A Human-Centred Quasi-Experiment on the Quality of LLM-Generated Behavioural Specifications from Food-Safety Regulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20744v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Laws and regulations increasingly affect software design and quality assurance, but legal texts are written in technology-neutral language. This creates challenges for engineers who must develop compliance artifacts such as requirements and acceptance criteria. Manual creation is labor-intensive, error-prone, and requires domain expertise. Advances in Generative AI (GenAI), especially Large Language Models (LLMs), offer a way to automate deriving such artifacts. Objective: We present the first systematic human-subject study of LLMs' ability to derive behavioral specifications from legal texts using a quasi-experimental design. These specifications translate legal requirements into a developer-friendly form. Methods: Ten participants evaluated specifications generated from food-safety regulations by Claude and Llama. Using Gherkin, a structured BDD language, 60 specifications were produced. Each participant assessed 12 across five criteria: Relevance, Clarity, Completeness, Singularity, and Time Savings. Each specification was reviewed by two participants, yielding 120 assessments. Results: For Relevance, 75% of ratings were highest and 20% second-highest. Clarity reached 90% highest. Completeness: 75% highest, 19% second. Singularity: 82% highest, 12% second. Time Savings: 68% highest, 24% second. No lowest ratings occurred. Mann-Whitney U tests showed no significant differences across participants or models. Llama slightly outperformed Claude in Clarity, Completeness, and Time Savings, while Claude was stronger in Singularity. Feedback noted hallucinations and omissions but confirmed the utility of the specifications. Conclusion: LLMs can generate high-quality Gherkin specifications from legal texts, reducing manual effort and providing structured artifacts useful for implementation, assurance, and test generation.</p></details> |  |

| **[The Integration of Agile Methodologies in DevOps Practices within the Information Technology Industry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21811v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The demand for rapid software delivery in the Information Technology (IT) industry has significantly intensified, emphasising the need for faster software products and service releases with enhanced features to meet customer expectations. Agile methodologies are replacing traditional approaches such as Waterfall, where flexibility, iterative development and adaptation to change are favoured over rigid planning and execution. DevOps, a subsequent evolution from Agile, emphasises collaborative efforts in development and operations teams, focusing on continuous integration and deployment to deliver resilient and high-quality software products and services. This study aims to critically assess both Agile and DevOps practices in the IT industry to identify the feasibility and applicability of Agile methods in DevOps practices. Eleven semi-structured interviews were conducted with Agile and DevOps practitioners in varying capacities across several sectors within the IT industry. Through thematic analysis, 51 unique codes were extracted and synthesised into 19 themes that reported on each phase of the DevOps lifecycle, specifically regarding the integration and implementation of Agile methods into DevOps practices. Based on the findings, a new understanding detailing the interrelationship of Agile methods in DevOps practices was discussed that met the research objectives.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 2 figures, conference</p></details> |
| **[Dually Hierarchical Drift Adaptation for Online Configuration Performance Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08730v4)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern configurable software systems need to learn models that correlate configuration and performance. However, when the system operates in dynamic environments, the workload variations, hardware changes, and system updates will inevitably introduce concept drifts at different levels - global drifts, which reshape the performance landscape of the entire configuration space; and local drifts, which only affect certain sub-regions of that space. As such, existing offline and transfer learning approaches can struggle to adapt to these implicit and unpredictable changes in real-time, rendering configuration performance learning challenging. To address this, we propose DHDA, an online configuration performance learning framework designed to capture and adapt to these drifts at different levels. The key idea is that DHDA adapts to both the local and global drifts using dually hierarchical adaptation: at the upper level, we redivide the data into different divisions, within each of which the local model is retrained, to handle global drifts only when necessary. At the lower level, the local models of the divisions can detect local drifts and adapt themselves asynchronously. To balance responsiveness and efficiency, DHDA combines incremental updates with periodic full retraining to minimize redundant computation when no drifts are detected. Through evaluating eight software systems and against state-of-the-art approaches, we show that DHDA achieves considerably better accuracy and can effectively adapt to drifts with up to 2x improvements, while incurring reasonable overhead and is able to improve different local models in handling concept drift.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICSE 2026</p></details> |
| **[Complete the Cycle: Reachability Types with Expressive Cyclic References (Extended Version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07328v3)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Local reasoning about programs that combine aliasing and mutable state is a longstanding challenge. Existing approaches -- ownership systems, linear and affine types, uniqueness types, and lexical effect tracking -- impose global restrictions such as uniqueness or linearity, or rely on shallow syntactic analyses. These designs fall short with higher-order functions and shared mutable state. Reachability Types (RT) track aliasing and separation in higher-order programs, ensuring runtime safety and non-interference. However, RT systems face three key limitations: (1) they prohibit cyclic references, ruling out non-terminating computations and fixed-point combinators; (2) they require deep tracking, where a qualifier must include all transitively reachable locations, reducing precision and hindering optimizations like fine-grained parallelism; and (3) referent qualifier invariance prevents referents from escaping their allocation contexts, making reference factories inexpressible. In this work, we address these limitations by extending RT with three mechanisms that enhance expressiveness. First, we introduce cyclic references, enabling recursive patterns to be encoded directly through the store. Second, we adopt shallow qualifier tracking, decoupling references from their transitively reachable values. Finally, we introduce an escaping rule with reference subtyping, allowing referent qualifiers to outlive their allocation context. These extensions are formalized in the $\mathsf{F}_{<:}^{\circ}$-calculus with a mechanized proof of type soundness, and case studies illustrate expressiveness through fixpoint combinators, non-interfering parallelism, and escaping read-only references.</p></details> |  |

FACTS combines real-time atmospheric data collected by IoT sensors with curated resources from a Knowledge Base to dynamically generate localized learning challenges. Learner responses are analyzed by a Generative AI powered server, which delivers personalized feedback and adaptive support. Results from a user evaluation indicate that participants found the system both easy to use and effective for building knowledge related to climate resilience. These findings suggest that integrating IoT and Generative AI into atmospherically adaptive learning technologies holds significant promise for enhancing educational engagement and fostering climate awareness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting Stealthy Data Poisoning Attacks in AI Code Generators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21636v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning (DL) models for natural language-to-code generation have become integral to modern software development pipelines. However, their heavy reliance on large amounts of data, often collected from unsanitized online sources, exposes them to data poisoning attacks, where adversaries inject malicious samples to subtly bias model behavior. Recent targeted attacks silently replace secure code with semantically equivalent but vulnerable implementations without relying on explicit triggers to launch the attack, making it especially hard for detection methods to distinguish clean from poisoned samples. We present a systematic study on the effectiveness of existing poisoning detection methods under this stealthy threat model. Specifically, we perform targeted poisoning on three DL models (CodeBERT, CodeT5+, AST-T5), and evaluate spectral signatures analysis, activation clustering, and static analysis as defenses. Our results show that all methods struggle to detect triggerless poisoning, with representation-based approaches failing to isolate poisoned samples and static analysis suffering false positives and false negatives, highlighting the need for more robust, trigger-independent defenses for AI-assisted code generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 3rd IEEE International Workshop on Reliable and Secure AI for Software Engineering (ReSAISE, 2025), co-located with ISSRE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Human-Written vs. AI-Generated Code: A Large-Scale Study of Defects, Vulnerabilities, and Complexity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21634v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI code assistants become increasingly integrated into software development workflows, understanding how their code compares to human-written programs is critical for ensuring reliability, maintainability, and security. In this paper, we present a large-scale comparison of code authored by human developers and three state-of-the-art LLMs, i.e., ChatGPT, DeepSeek-Coder, and Qwen-Coder, on multiple dimensions of software quality: code defects, security vulnerabilities, and structural complexity. Our evaluation spans over 500k code samples in two widely used languages, Python and Java, classifying defects via Orthogonal Defect Classification and security vulnerabilities using the Common Weakness Enumeration. We find that AI-generated code is generally simpler and more repetitive, yet more prone to unused constructs and hardcoded debugging, while human-written code exhibits greater structural complexity and a higher concentration of maintainability issues. Notably, AI-generated code also contains more high-risk security vulnerabilities. These findings highlight the distinct defect profiles of AI- and human-authored code and underscore the need for specialized quality assurance practices in AI-assisted programming.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 36th IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE, 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Reusable Test Suites for Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21553v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) agents show great promise in solving sequential decision-making tasks. However, validating the reliability and performance of the agent policies' behavior for deployment remains challenging. Most reinforcement learning policy testing methods produce test suites tailored to the agent policy being tested, and their relevance to other policies is unclear. This work presents Multi-Policy Test Case Selection (MPTCS), a novel automated test suite selection method for RL environments, designed to extract test cases generated by any policy testing framework based on their solvability, diversity, and general difficulty. MPTCS uses a set of policies to select a diverse collection of reusable policy-agnostic test cases that reveal typical flaws in the agents' behavior. The set of policies selects test cases from a candidate pool, which can be generated by any policy testing method, based on a difficulty score. We assess the effectiveness of the difficulty score and how the method's effectiveness and cost depend on the number of policies in the set. Additionally, a method for promoting diversity in the test suite, a discretized general test case descriptor surface inspired by quality-diversity algorithms, is examined to determine how it covers the state space and which policies it triggers to produce faulty behaviors.</p></details> |  |
