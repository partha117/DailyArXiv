| **[Software Model Checking via Summary-Guided Search (Extended Version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15137v2)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we describe a new software model-checking algorithm called GPS. GPS treats the task of model checking a program as a directed search of the program states, guided by a compositional, summary-based static analysis. The summaries produced by static analysis are used both to prune away infeasible paths and to drive test generation to reach new, unexplored program states. GPS can find both proofs of safety and counter-examples to safety (i.e., inputs that trigger bugs), and features a novel two-layered search strategy that renders it particularly efficient at finding bugs in programs featuring long, input-dependent error paths. To make GPS refutationally complete (in the sense that it will find an error if one exists, if it is allotted enough time), we introduce an instrumentation technique and show that it helps GPS achieve refutation-completeness without sacrificing overall performance. We benchmarked GPS on a suite of benchmarks including both programs from the Software Verification Competition (SV-COMP) and from prior literature, and found that our implementation of GPS outperforms state-of-the-art software model checkers (including the top performers in SV-COMP ReachSafety-Loops category), both in terms of the number of benchmarks solved and in terms of running time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of paper in OOPSLA 2025 (with updated evaluations section compared to v1 manuscript). 37 pages</p></details> |
| **[ARSP: Automated Repair of Verilog Designs via Semantic Partitioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16517v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging functional Verilog bugs consumes a significant portion of front-end design time. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in mitigating this effort, existing LLM-based automated debugging methods underperform on industrial-scale modules. A major reason for this is bug signal dilution in long contexts, where a few bug-relevant tokens are overwhelmed by hundreds of unrelated lines, diffusing the model's attention. To address this issue, we introduce ARSP, a two-stage system that mitigates dilution via semantics-guided fragmentation. A Partition LLM splits a module into semantically tight fragments; a Repair LLM patches each fragment; edits are merged without altering unrelated logic. A synthetic data framework generates fragment-level training pairs spanning bug types, design styles, and scales to supervise both models. Experiments show that ARSP achieves 77.92% pass@1 and 83.88% pass@5, outperforming mainstream commercial LLMs including Claude-3.7 and SOTA automated Verilog debugging tools Strider and MEIC. Also, semantic partitioning improves pass@1 by 11.6% and pass@5 by 10.2% over whole-module debugging, validating the effectiveness of fragment-level scope reduction in LLM-based Verilog debugging.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoVerus: Automated Proof Generation for Rust Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13082v3)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI has shown its values for many software engineering tasks. Still in its infancy, large language model (LLM)-based proof generation lags behind LLM-based code generation. In this paper, we present AutoVerus. AutoVerus uses LLMs to automatically generate correctness proof for Rust code. AutoVerus is designed to match the unique features of Verus, a verification tool that can prove the correctness of Rust code using proofs and specifications also written in Rust. AutoVerus consists of a network of LLM agents that are crafted and orchestrated to mimic human experts' three phases of proof construction: preliminary proof generation, proof refinement guided by generic tips, and proof debugging guided by verification errors. To thoroughly evaluate AutoVerus and help foster future research in this direction, we have built a benchmark suite of 150 non-trivial proof tasks, based on existing code-generation benchmarks and verification benchmarks. Our evaluation shows that AutoVerus can automatically generate correct proof for more than 90% of them, with more than half of them tackled in less than 30 seconds or 3 LLM calls.</p></details> | OOPSLA 2025 |
| **[Using LLMs and Essence to Support Software Practice Adoption](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16445v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP) have enabled the development of automated tools that support various domains, including software engineering. However, while NLP and artificial intelligence (AI) research has extensively focused on tasks such as code generation, less attention has been given to automating support for the adoption of best practices, the evolution of ways of working, and the monitoring of process health. This study addresses this gap by exploring the integration of Essence, a standard and thinking framework for managing software engineering practices, with large language models (LLMs). To this end, a specialised chatbot was developed to assist students and professionals in understanding and applying Essence. The chatbot employs a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system to retrieve relevant contextual information from a curated knowledge base. Four different LLMs were used to create multiple chatbot configurations, each evaluated both as a base model and augmented with the RAG system. The system performance was evaluated through both the relevance of retrieved context and the quality of generated responses. Comparative analysis against the general-purpose LLMs demonstrated that the proposed system consistently outperforms its baseline counterpart in domain-specific tasks. By facilitating access to structured software engineering knowledge, this work contributes to bridging the gap between theoretical frameworks and practical application, potentially improving process management and the adoption of software development practices. While further validation through user studies is required, these findings highlight the potential of LLM-based automation to enhance learning and decision-making in software engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Classification or Prompting: A Case Study on Legal Requirements Traceability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04916v4)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>New regulations are introduced to ensure software development aligns with ethical concerns and protects public safety. Showing compliance requires tracing requirements to legal provisions. Requirements traceability is a key task where engineers must analyze technical requirements against target artifacts, often within limited time. Manually analyzing complex systems with hundreds of requirements is infeasible. The legal dimension adds challenges that increase effort. In this paper, we investigate two automated solutions based on language models, including large ones (LLMs). The first solution, Kashif, is a classifier that leverages sentence transformers and semantic similarity. The second solution, RICE_LRT, prompts a recent generative LLM based on RICE, a prompt engineering framework. On a benchmark dataset, we empirically evaluate Kashif and compare it against five different baseline classifiers from the literature. Kashif can identify trace links with a recall of 67%, precision of 50%, and F2 score of 63%, outperforming the best baseline by a substantial margin of 41 percentage points (pp) in F2. However, on unseen, more complex requirements documents traced to the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Kashif performs poorly, yielding an average recall of 15%, an average precision of 10%, and an average F2 score of 13.5%. On the same documents, however, our RICE solution yields an average recall of 84%, an average precision of 30%, and an average F2 score of 61%. RICE achieved a remarkable improvement of 47.5 pp over Kashif in terms of F2 score. Our results suggest that requirements traceability in the legal context cannot be simply addressed by building classifiers, as such solutions do not generalize and fail to perform well on complex regulations and requirements. Resorting to generative LLMs, with careful prompt engineering, is thus a more promising alternative.</p></details> | 38 pages, 4 figues |
| **[LLM-GUARD: Large Language Model-Based Detection and Repair of Bugs and Security Vulnerabilities in C++ and Python](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16419v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT-4, Claude 3, and LLaMA 4 are increasingly embedded in software/application development, supporting tasks from code generation to debugging. Yet, their real-world effectiveness in detecting diverse software bugs, particularly complex, security-relevant vulnerabilities, remains underexplored. This study presents a systematic, empirical evaluation of these three leading LLMs using a benchmark of foundational programming errors, classic security flaws, and advanced, production-grade bugs in C++ and Python. The dataset integrates real code from SEED Labs, OpenSSL (via the Suresoft GLaDOS database), and PyBugHive, validated through local compilation and testing pipelines. A novel multi-stage, context-aware prompting protocol simulates realistic debugging scenarios, while a graded rubric measures detection accuracy, reasoning depth, and remediation quality. Our results show that all models excel at identifying syntactic and semantic issues in well-scoped code, making them promising for educational use and as first-pass reviewers in automated code auditing. Performance diminishes in scenarios involving complex security vulnerabilities and large-scale production code, with ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3 generally providing more nuanced contextual analyses than LLaMA 4. This highlights both the promise and the present constraints of LLMs in serving as reliable code analysis tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[AetherCode: Evaluating LLMs' Ability to Win In Premier Programming Competitions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16402v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Competitive programming has emerged as a critical benchmark for evaluating the reasoning and coding capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite impressive progress on existing benchmarks, we argue that current evaluations overstate model proficiency, masking a substantial gap between LLMs and elite human programmers. This gap arises from two key limitations: insufficient difficulty and scope of benchmark problems, and evaluation bias from low-quality test cases. To address these shortcomings, we present AetherCode, a new benchmark that draws problems from premier programming competitions such as IOI and ICPC, offering broader coverage and higher difficulty. AetherCode further incorporates comprehensive, expert-validated test suites built through a hybrid of automated generation and human curation, ensuring rigorous and reliable assessment. By combining challenging problem design with robust evaluation, AetherCode provides a more faithful measure of LLM capabilities and sets a new standard for future research in code reasoning.</p></details> | 15 pages |
| **[Understanding the Issues, Their Causes and Solutions in Microservices Systems: An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01894v3)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many small to large organizations have adopted the Microservices Architecture (MSA) style to develop and deliver their core businesses. Despite the popularity of MSA in the software industry, there is a limited evidence-based and thorough understanding of the types of issues (e.g., errors, faults, failures, and bugs) that microservices system developers experience, the causes of the issues, and the solutions as potential fixing strategies to address the issues. To ameliorate this gap, we conducted a mixed-methods empirical study that collected data from 2,641 issues from the issue tracking systems of 15 open-source microservices systems on GitHub, 15 interviews, and an online survey completed by 150 practitioners from 42 countries across 6 continents. Our analysis led to comprehensive taxonomies for the issues, causes, and solutions. The findings of this study informthat Technical Debt, Continuous Integration and Delivery, Exception Handling, Service Execution and Communication, and Security are the most dominant issues in microservices systems. Furthermore, General Programming Errors, Missing Features and Artifacts, and Invalid Configuration and Communication are the main causes behind the issues. Finally, we found 177 types of solutions that can be applied to fix the identified issues. Based on our study results, we formulated future research directions that could help researchers and practitioners to engineer emergent and next-generation microservices systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 5 images, 7 tables, Manuscript submitted to a Journal (2025)</p></details> |
| **[Mutation-Guided Unit Test Generation with a Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02954v4)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unit tests play a vital role in uncovering potential faults in software. While tools like EvoSuite focus on maximizing code coverage, recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shifted attention toward LLM-based test generation. However, code coverage metrics -- such as line and branch coverage -- remain overly emphasized in reported research, despite being weak indicators of a test suite's fault-detection capability. In contrast, mutation score offers a more reliable and stringent measure, as demonstrated in our findings where some test suites achieve 100% coverage but only 4% mutation score. Although a few studies consider mutation score, the effectiveness of LLMs in killing mutants remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose MUTGEN, a mutation-guided, LLM-based test generation approach that incorporates mutation feedback directly into the prompt. Evaluated on 204 subjects from two benchmarks, MUTGEN significantly outperforms both EvoSuite and vanilla prompt-based strategies in terms of mutation score. Furthermore, MUTGEN introduces an iterative generation mechanism that pushes the limits of LLMs in killing additional mutants. Our study also provide insights into the limitations of LLM-based generation, analyzing the reasons for live and uncovered mutants, and the impact of different mutation operators on generation effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[SATORI: Static Test Oracle Generation for REST APIs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16318v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>REST API test case generation tools are evolving rapidly, with growing capabilities for the automated generation of complex tests. However, despite their strengths in test data generation, these tools are constrained by the types of test oracles they support, often limited to crashes, regressions, and noncompliance with API specifications or design standards. This paper introduces SATORI (Static API Test ORacle Inference), a black-box approach for generating test oracles for REST APIs by analyzing their OpenAPI Specification. SATORI uses large language models to infer the expected behavior of an API by analyzing the properties of the response fields of its operations, such as their name and descriptions. To foster its adoption, we extended the PostmanAssertify tool to automatically convert the test oracles reported by SATORI into executable assertions. Evaluation results on 17 operations from 12 industrial APIs show that SATORI can automatically generate up to hundreds of valid test oracles per operation. SATORI achieved an F1-score of 74.3%, outperforming the state-of-the-art dynamic approach AGORA+ (69.3%)-which requires executing the API-when generating comparable oracle types. Moreover, our findings show that static and dynamic oracle inference methods are complementary: together, SATORI and AGORA+ found 90% of the oracles in our annotated ground-truth dataset. Notably, SATORI uncovered 18 bugs in popular APIs (Amadeus Hotel, Deutschebahn, FDIC, GitLab, Marvel, OMDb and Vimeo) leading to documentation updates by the API maintainers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, ASE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Metamorphic Coverage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16307v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metamorphic testing is a widely used methodology that examines an expected relation between pairs of executions to automatically find bugs, such as correctness bugs. We found that code coverage cannot accurately measure the extent to which code is validated and mutation testing is computationally expensive for evaluating metamorphic testing methods. In this work, we propose Metamorphic Coverage (MC), a coverage metric that examines the distinct code executed by pairs of test inputs within metamorphic testing. Our intuition is that, typically, a bug can be observed if the corresponding code is executed when executing either test input but not the other one, so covering more differential code covered by pairs of test inputs might be more likely to expose bugs. While most metamorphic testing methods have been based on this general intuition, our work defines and systematically evaluates MC on five widely used metamorphic testing methods for testing database engines, compilers, and constraint solvers. The code measured by MC overlaps with the bug-fix locations of 50 of 64 bugs found by metamorphic testing methods, and MC has a stronger positive correlation with bug numbers than line coverage. MC is 4x more sensitive than line coverage in distinguishing testing methods' effectiveness, and the average value of MC is 6x smaller than line coverage while still capturing the part of the program that is being tested. MC required 359x less time than mutation testing. Based on a case study for an automated database system testing approach, we demonstrate that when used for feedback guidance, MC significantly outperforms code coverage, by finding 41\% more bugs. Consequently, this work might have broad applications for assessing metamorphic testing methods and improving test-case generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mining Constraints from Reference Process Models for Detecting Best-Practice Violations in Event Logs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02336v2)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting undesired process behavior is one of the main tasks of process mining and various conformance-checking techniques have been developed to this end. These techniques typically require a normative process model as input, specifically designed for the processes to be analyzed. Such models are rarely available, though, and their creation involves considerable manual effort.However, reference process models serve as best-practice templates for organizational processes in a plethora of domains, containing valuable knowledge about general behavioral relations in well-engineered processes. These general models can thus mitigate the need for dedicated models by providing a basis to check for undesired behavior. Still, finding a perfectly matching reference model for a real-life event log is unrealistic because organizational needs can vary, despite similarities in process execution. Furthermore, event logs may encompass behavior related to different reference models, making traditional conformance checking impractical as it requires aligning process executions to individual models. To still use reference models for conformance checking, we propose a framework for mining declarative best-practice constraints from a reference model collection, automatically selecting constraints that are relevant for a given event log, and checking for best-practice violations. We demonstrate the capability of our framework to detect best-practice violations through an evaluation based on real-world process model collections and event logs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to Information Systems</p></details> |

This challenge is amplified when targeting newer or less-documented GPU architectures where traditional development aids are scarce. This paper introduces an LLM-powered "GPU Kernel Scientist," an automated methodology for iteratively refining accelerator kernels. Our methodology employs LLMs in a multi-stage, evolutionary process: (a) strategically selecting promising prior code versions as a basis for new iterations; (b) generating hypotheses for optimization experiments, based on existing code and assimilated knowledge from general GPU literature; and (c) autonomously implementing these experiments through code modification and subsequent submission to an external evaluation system, using only observed timing data as performance feedback. We detail how this approach navigates the challenges of the AMD MI300 target architecture and leverages LLMs to compensate for limited domain-specific human expertise. In addition to our results, we present the architectural design, operational workflow, and qualitative insights, highlighting the potential of LLM-driven agents to democratise and accelerate GPU kernel optimization, especially in resource-constrained or rapidly updating hardware environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>4+1 p...</summary><p>4+1 page paper plus Appendices and Supplementary zip file.

Evaluated on 204 subjects from two benchmarks, MUTGEN significantly outperforms both EvoSuite and vanilla prompt-based strategies in terms of mutation score. Furthermore, MUTGEN introduces an iterative generation mechanism that pushes the limits of LLMs in killing additional mutants. Our study also provide insights into the limitations of LLM-based generation, analyzing the reasons for live and uncovered mutants, and the impact of different mutation operators on generation effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

However, despite their strengths in test data generation, these tools are constrained by the types of test oracles they support, often limited to crashes, regressions, and noncompliance with API specifications or design standards. This paper introduces SATORI (Static API Test ORacle Inference), a black-box approach for generating test oracles for REST APIs by analyzing their OpenAPI Specification. SATORI uses large language models to infer the expected behavior of an API by analyzing the properties of the response fields of its operations, such as their name and descriptions. To foster its adoption, we extended the PostmanAssertify tool to automatically convert the test oracles reported by SATORI into executable assertions. Evaluation results on 17 operations from 12 industrial APIs show that SATORI can automatically generate up to hundreds of valid test oracles per operation. SATORI achieved an F1-score of 74.3%, outperforming the state-of-the-art dynamic approach AGORA+ (69.3%)-which requires executing the API-when generating comparable oracle types. Moreover, our findings show that static and dynamic oracle inference methods are complementary: together, SATORI and AGORA+ found 90% of the oracles in our annotated ground-truth dataset. Notably, SATORI uncovered 18 bugs in popular APIs (Amadeus Hotel, Deutschebahn, FDIC, GitLab, Marvel, OMDb and Vimeo) leading to documentation updates by the API maintainers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, ASE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Metamorphic Coverage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16307v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metamorphic testing is a widely used methodology that examines an expected relation between pairs of executions to automatically find bugs, such as correctness bugs. We found that code coverage cannot accurately measure the extent to which code is validated and mutation testing is computationally expensive for evaluating metamorphic testing methods. In this work, we propose Metamorphic Coverage (MC), a coverage metric that examines the distinct code executed by pairs of test inputs within metamorphic testing. Our intuition is that, typically, a bug can be observed if the corresponding code is executed when executing either test input but not the other one, so covering more differential code covered by pairs of test inputs might be more likely to expose bugs. While most metamorphic testing methods have been based on this general intuition, our work defines and systematically evaluates MC on five widely used metamorphic testing methods for testing database engines, compilers, and constraint solvers. The code measured by MC overlaps with the bug-fix locations of 50 of 64 bugs found by metamorphic testing methods, and MC has a stronger positive correlation with bug numbers than line coverage. MC is 4x more sensitive than line coverage in distinguishing testing methods' effectiveness, and the average value of MC is 6x smaller than line coverage while still capturing the part of the program that is being tested. MC required 359x less time than mutation testing. Based on a case study for an automated database system testing approach, we demonstrate that when used for feedback guidance, MC significantly outperforms code coverage, by finding 41\% more bugs. Consequently, this work might have broad applications for assessing metamorphic testing methods and improving test-case generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mining Constraints from Reference Process Models for Detecting Best-Practice Violations in Event Logs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02336v2)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting undesired process behavior is one of the main tasks of process mining and various conformance-checking techniques have been developed to this end. These techniques typically require a normative process model as input, specifically designed for the processes to be analyzed. Such models are rarely available, though, and their creation involves considerable manual effort.However, reference process models serve as best-practice templates for organizational processes in a plethora of domains, containing valuable knowledge about general behavioral relations in well-engineered processes. These general models can thus mitigate the need for dedicated models by providing a basis to check for undesired behavior. Still, finding a perfectly matching reference model for a real-life event log is unrealistic because organizational needs can vary, despite similarities in process execution. Furthermore, event logs may encompass behavior related to different reference models, making traditional conformance checking impractical as it requires aligning process executions to individual models. To still use reference models for conformance checking, we propose a framework for mining declarative best-practice constraints from a reference model collection, automatically selecting constraints that are relevant for a given event log, and checking for best-practice violations. We demonstrate the capability of our framework to detect best-practice violations through an evaluation based on real-world process model collections and event logs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to Information Systems</p></details> |

This challenge is amplified when targeting newer or less-documented GPU architectures where traditional development aids are scarce. This paper introduces an LLM-powered "GPU Kernel Scientist," an automated methodology for iteratively refining accelerator kernels. Our methodology employs LLMs in a multi-stage, evolutionary process: (a) strategically selecting promising prior code versions as a basis for new iterations; (b) generating hypotheses for optimization experiments, based on existing code and assimilated knowledge from general GPU literature; and (c) autonomously implementing these experiments through code modification and subsequent submission to an external evaluation system, using only observed timing data as performance feedback. We detail how this approach navigates the challenges of the AMD MI300 target architecture and leverages LLMs to compensate for limited domain-specific human expertise. In addition to our results, we present the architectural design, operational workflow, and qualitative insights, highlighting the potential of LLM-driven agents to democratise and accelerate GPU kernel optimization, especially in resource-constrained or rapidly updating hardware environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>4+1 p...</summary><p>4+1 page paper plus Appendices and Supplementary zip file.

| **[ARSP: Automated Repair of Verilog Designs via Semantic Partitioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16517v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging functional Verilog bugs consumes a significant portion of front-end design time. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in mitigating this effort, existing LLM-based automated debugging methods underperform on industrial-scale modules. A major reason for this is bug signal dilution in long contexts, where a few bug-relevant tokens are overwhelmed by hundreds of unrelated lines, diffusing the model's attention. To address this issue, we introduce ARSP, a two-stage system that mitigates dilution via semantics-guided fragmentation. A Partition LLM splits a module into semantically tight fragments; a Repair LLM patches each fragment; edits are merged without altering unrelated logic. A synthetic data framework generates fragment-level training pairs spanning bug types, design styles, and scales to supervise both models. Experiments show that ARSP achieves 77.92% pass@1 and 83.88% pass@5, outperforming mainstream commercial LLMs including Claude-3.7 and SOTA automated Verilog debugging tools Strider and MEIC. Also, semantic partitioning improves pass@1 by 11.6% and pass@5 by 10.2% over whole-module debugging, validating the effectiveness of fragment-level scope reduction in LLM-based Verilog debugging.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoVerus: Automated Proof Generation for Rust Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13082v3)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI has shown its values for many software engineering tasks. Still in its infancy, large language model (LLM)-based proof generation lags behind LLM-based code generation. In this paper, we present AutoVerus. AutoVerus uses LLMs to automatically generate correctness proof for Rust code. AutoVerus is designed to match the unique features of Verus, a verification tool that can prove the correctness of Rust code using proofs and specifications also written in Rust. AutoVerus consists of a network of LLM agents that are crafted and orchestrated to mimic human experts' three phases of proof construction: preliminary proof generation, proof refinement guided by generic tips, and proof debugging guided by verification errors. To thoroughly evaluate AutoVerus and help foster future research in this direction, we have built a benchmark suite of 150 non-trivial proof tasks, based on existing code-generation benchmarks and verification benchmarks. Our evaluation shows that AutoVerus can automatically generate correct proof for more than 90% of them, with more than half of them tackled in less than 30 seconds or 3 LLM calls.</p></details> | OOPSLA 2025 |

Yet, their real-world effectiveness in detecting diverse software bugs, particularly complex, security-relevant vulnerabilities, remains underexplored. This study presents a systematic, empirical evaluation of these three leading LLMs using a benchmark of foundational programming errors, classic security flaws, and advanced, production-grade bugs in C++ and Python. The dataset integrates real code from SEED Labs, OpenSSL (via the Suresoft GLaDOS database), and PyBugHive, validated through local compilation and testing pipelines. A novel multi-stage, context-aware prompting protocol simulates realistic debugging scenarios, while a graded rubric measures detection accuracy, reasoning depth, and remediation quality. Our results show that all models excel at identifying syntactic and semantic issues in well-scoped code, making them promising for educational use and as first-pass reviewers in automated code auditing. Performance diminishes in scenarios involving complex security vulnerabilities and large-scale production code, with ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3 generally providing more nuanced contextual analyses than LLaMA 4. This highlights both the promise and the present constraints of LLMs in serving as reliable code analysis tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Generate Unit Tests for Automated Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01619v3)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unit tests (UTs) play an instrumental role in assessing code correctness as well as providing feedback to large language models (LLMs), motivating automated test generation. However, we uncover a trade-off between generating unit test inputs that reveal errors when given a faulty code and correctly predicting the unit test output without access to the gold solution. To address this trade-off, we propose UTGen, which teaches LLMs to generate unit test inputs that reveal errors along with their correct expected outputs based on task descriptions. Since model-generated tests can provide noisy signals (e.g., from incorrectly predicted outputs), we propose UTDebug that (i) scales UTGen via test-time compute to improve UT output prediction, and (ii) validates and backtracks edits based on multiple generated UTs to avoid overfitting, and helps LLMs debug effectively. We show that UTGen outperforms other LLM-based baselines by 7.59% based on a metric measuring the presence of both error-revealing UT inputs and correct UT outputs. When used with UTDebug, we find that feedback from UTGen's unit tests improves pass@1 accuracy of Qwen2.5 32B on HumanEvalFix and our own harder debugging split of MBPP+ by over 3.17% and 12.35% (respectively) over other LLM-based UT generation baselines. Moreover, we observe that feedback from Qwen2.5 32B-based UTGen model can enhance debugging with frontier LLMs like GPT-4o by 13.8%. Lastly, we demonstrate that UTGen is a better judge for code correctness, outperforming a state-of-the-art trained 8B reward model by 4.43% on HumanEval+ with best-of-10 sampling using Qwen2.5 7B.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLM 2025.

This problem is especially evident in increasingly complex and distributed software systems. Therefore, our objective of this work is to introduce an approach that can possibly be applied to any system, at both the macro- and micro-level, to ease this debugging process. This approach utilizes a system's process data, in conjunction with generative AI, to generate natural-language explanations. These explanations are generated from the actual process data, interface information, and documentation to guide the developers more efficiently to understand the behavior and possible errors of a process and its sub-processes. Here, we present a demonstrator that employs this approach on a component-based Java system. However, our approach is language-agnostic. Ideally, the generated explanations will provide a good understanding of the process, even if developers are not familiar with all the details of the considered system. Our demonstrator is provided as an open-source web application that is freely accessible to all users.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at ICWE 2025, Delft (30 June - 03 July 2025)</p></details> |
| **[AgentSight: System-Level Observability for AI Agents Using eBPF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02736v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern software infrastructure increasingly relies on LLM agents for development and maintenance, such as Claude Code and Gemini-cli. However, these AI agents differ fundamentally from traditional deterministic software, posing a significant challenge to conventional monitoring and debugging. This creates a critical semantic gap: existing tools observe either an agent's high-level intent (via LLM prompts) or its low-level actions (e.g., system calls), but cannot correlate these two views. This blindness makes it difficult to distinguish between benign operations, malicious attacks, and costly failures. We introduce AgentSight, an AgentOps observability framework that bridges this semantic gap using a hybrid approach. Our approach, boundary tracing, monitors agents from outside their application code at stable system interfaces using eBPF. AgentSight intercepts TLS-encrypted LLM traffic to extract semantic intent, monitors kernel events to observe system-wide effects, and causally correlates these two streams across process boundaries using a real-time engine and secondary LLM analysis. This instrumentation-free technique is framework-agnostic, resilient to rapid API changes, and incurs less than 3% performance overhead. Our evaluation shows AgentSight detects prompt injection attacks, identifies resource-wasting reasoning loops, and reveals hidden coordination bottlenecks in multi-agent systems. AgentSight is released as an open-source project at https://github.com/agent-sight/agentsight.</p></details> |  |
| **[Defects4Log: Benchmarking LLMs for Logging Code Defect Detection and Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11305v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logging code is written by developers to capture system runtime behavior and plays a vital role in debugging, performance analysis, and system monitoring. However, defects in logging code can undermine the usefulness of logs and lead to misinterpretations. Although prior work has identified several logging defect patterns and provided valuable insights into logging practices, these studies often focus on a narrow range of defect patterns derived from limited sources (e.g., commit histories) and lack a systematic and comprehensive analysis. Moreover, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising generalization and reasoning capabilities across a variety of code-related tasks, yet their potential for detecting logging code defects remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we derive a comprehensive taxonomy of logging code defects, which encompasses seven logging code defect patterns with 14 detailed scenarios. We further construct a benchmark dataset, \dataset, consisting of 164 developer-verified real-world logging defects. Then we propose an automated framework that leverages various prompting strategies and contextual information to evaluate LLMs' capability in detecting and reasoning logging code defects. Experimental results reveal that LLMs generally struggle to accurately detect and reason logging code defects based on the source code only. However, incorporating proper knowledge (e.g., detailed scenarios of defect patterns) can lead to 10.9\% improvement in detection accuracy. Overall, our findings provide actionable guidance for practitioners to avoid common defect patterns and establish a foundation for improving LLM-based reasoning in logging code defect detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniLLP: Enhancing LLM-based Log Level Prediction with Context-Aware Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08545v1)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developers insert logging statements in source code to capture relevant runtime information essential for maintenance and debugging activities. Log level choice is an integral, yet tricky part of the logging activity as it controls log verbosity and therefore influences systems' observability and performance. Recent advances in ML-based log level prediction have leveraged large language models (LLMs) to propose log level predictors (LLPs) that demonstrated promising performance improvements (AUC between 0.64 and 0.8). Nevertheless, current LLM-based LLPs rely on randomly selected in-context examples, overlooking the structure and the diverse logging practices within modern software projects. In this paper, we propose OmniLLP, a novel LLP enhancement framework that clusters source files based on (1) semantic similarity reflecting the code's functional purpose, and (2) developer ownership cohesion. By retrieving in-context learning examples exclusively from these semantic and ownership aware clusters, we aim to provide more coherent prompts to LLPs leveraging LLMs, thereby improving their predictive accuracy. Our results show that both semantic and ownership-aware clusterings statistically significantly improve the accuracy (by up to 8\% AUC) of the evaluated LLM-based LLPs compared to random predictors (i.e., leveraging randomly selected in-context examples from the whole project). Additionally, our approach that combines the semantic and ownership signal for in-context prediction achieves an impressive 0.88 to 0.96 AUC across our evaluated projects. Our findings highlight the value of integrating software engineering-specific context, such as code semantic and developer ownership signals into LLM-LLPs, offering developers a more accurate, contextually-aware approach to logging and therefore, enhancing system maintainability and observability.</p></details> |  |
| **[CP-Agent: Agentic Constraint Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07468v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Translating natural language problem descriptions into formal constraint models remains a fundamental challenge in constraint programming, requiring deep expertise in both the problem domain and modeling frameworks. Previous approaches to automating this translation have employed fixed workflows with predetermined modeling steps, failing on a significant number of benchmark problems. We present a new approach using a pure agentic strategy without any fixed pipeline. We developed a general-purpose Python coding agent based on the ReAct (Reason and Act) principle, utilizing a persistent IPython kernel for stateful code execution and iterative development. Rather than embedding constraint programming logic into the agent architecture, domain-specific expertise is injected solely through a carefully crafted project prompt. The agent combines this prompt-encoded knowledge with access to file operations and code execution tools, enabling it to test hypotheses, debug failures, and verify solutions dynamically. Implemented in just a few hundred lines of code, this architecture successfully solves all 101 problems of the CP-Bench constraint programming benchmark set. The results suggest that constraint modeling tasks require the combination of general coding tools and domain expertise encoded in prompts, rather than specialized agent architectures or predefined workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[TraceLens: Question-Driven Debugging for Taint Flow Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07198v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Taint analysis is a security analysis technique used to track the flow of potentially dangerous data through an application and its dependent libraries. Investigating why certain unexpected flows appear and why expected flows are missing is an important sensemaking process during end-user taint analysis. Existing taint analysis tools often do not provide this end-user debugging capability, where developers can ask why, why-not, and what-if questions about dataflows and reason about the impact of configuring sources and sinks, and models of 3rd-party libraries that abstract permissible and impermissible data flows. Furthermore, a tree-view or a list-view used in existing taint-analyzer's visualization makes it difficult to reason about the global impact on connectivity between multiple sources and sinks. Inspired by the insight that sensemaking tool-generated results can be significantly improved by a QA inquiry process, we propose TraceLens, a first end-user question-answer style debugging interface for taint analysis. It enables a user to ask why, why-not, and what-if questions to investigate the existence of suspicious flows, the non-existence of expected flows, and the global impact of third-party library models. TraceLens performs speculative what-if analysis, to help a user in debugging how different connectivity assumptions affect overall results. A user study with 12 participants shows that participants using TraceLens achieved 21% higher accuracy on average, compared to CodeQL. They also reported a 45% reduction in mental demand (NASA-TLX) and rated higher confidence in identifying relevant flows using TraceLens.</p></details> |  |

However, their continued advancement is constrained by the scarcity of high-quality, publicly available supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets tailored for coding tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce OpenCodeInstruct, the largest open-access instruction tuning dataset, comprising 5 million diverse samples. Each sample includes a programming question, solution, test cases, execution feedback, and LLM-generated quality assessments. We fine-tune various base models, including LLaMA and Qwen, across multiple scales (1B+, 3B+, and 7B+) using our dataset. Comprehensive evaluations on popular benchmarks (HumanEval, MBPP, LiveCodeBench, and BigCodeBench) demonstrate substantial performance improvements achieved by SFT with OpenCodeInstruct. We also present a detailed methodology encompassing seed data curation, synthetic instruction and solution generation, and filtering.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[From Code to Correctness: Closing the Last Mile of Code Generation with Hierarchical Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01215v3)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models have made significant strides in code generation, the pass rate of the generated code is bottlenecked on subtle errors, often requiring human intervention to pass tests, especially for complex problems. Existing LLM-based debugging systems treat generated programs as monolithic units, failing to address bugs at multiple levels of granularity, from low-level syntax errors to high-level algorithmic flaws. In this paper, we introduce Multi-Granularity Debugger (MGDebugger), a hierarchical code debugger by isolating, identifying, and resolving bugs at various levels of granularity. MGDebugger decomposes problematic code into a hierarchical tree structure of subfunctions, with each level representing a particular granularity of error. During debugging, it analyzes each subfunction and iteratively resolves bugs in a bottom-up manner. To effectively test each subfunction, we propose an LLM-simulated Python executor, which traces code execution and tracks important variable states to pinpoint errors accurately. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGDebugger outperforms existing debugging systems, achieving an 18.9% improvement in accuracy over seed generations in HumanEval and a 97.6% repair success rate in HumanEvalFix. Furthermore, MGDebugger effectively fixes bugs across different categories and difficulty levels, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data available at https://github.com/YerbaPage/MGDebugger</p></details> |

Given the ability of large language models (LLMs) to generate natural language and code, researchers are exploring their potential to generate log statements. However, prior work focuses on evaluating logs introduced in code functions, leaving file-level log generation underexplored -- especially in machine learning (ML) applications, where comprehensive logging can enhance reliability. In this study, we evaluate the capacity of GPT-4o mini as a case study to generate log statements for ML projects at file level. We gathered a set of 171 ML repositories containing 4,073 Python files with at least one log statement. We identified and removed the original logs from the files, prompted the LLM to generate logs for them, and evaluated both the position of the logs and log level, variables, and text quality of the generated logs compared to human-written logs. In addition, we manually analyzed a representative sample of generated logs to identify common patterns and challenges. We find that the LLM introduces logs in the same place as humans in 63.91% of cases, but at the cost of a high overlogging rate of 82.66%. Furthermore, our manual analysis reveals challenges for file-level logging, which shows overlogging at the beginning or end of a function, difficulty logging within large code blocks, and misalignment with project-specific logging conventions. While the LLM shows promise for generating logs for complete files, these limitations remain to be addressed for practical implementation.</p></details> |  |

This study benchmarks these four prominent LLMs on one hundred and fifty LeetCode problems across easy, medium, and hard difficulties, generating solutions in Java and Python. We evaluate each model based on execution time, memory usage, and algorithmic complexity, revealing significant performance differences. ChatGPT demonstrates consistent efficiency in execution time and memory usage, while Copilot and DeepSeek show variability as task complexity increases. Gemini, although effective on simpler tasks, requires more attempts as problem difficulty rises.

Does this expectation materialize in practice? How do we find out, making sure that proposed corrections actually work? If programmers have access to LLMs, how do they actually use them to complement their own skills? To answer these questions, we took advantage of the availability of a program-proving environment, which formally determines the correctness of proposed fixes, to conduct a study of program debugging with two randomly assigned groups of programmers, one with access to LLMs and the other without, both validating their answers through the proof tools. The methodology relied on a division into general research questions (Goals in the Goal-Query-Metric approach), specific elements admitting specific answers (Queries), and measurements supporting these answers (Metrics). While applied so far to a limited sample size, the results are a first step towards delineating a proper role for AI and LLMs in providing guaranteed-correct fixes to program bugs. These results caused surprise as compared to what one might expect from the use of AI for debugging and APR. The contributions also include: a detailed methodology for experiments in the use of LLMs for debugging, which other projects can reuse; a fine-grain analysis of programmer behavior, made possible by the use of full-session recording; a definition of patterns of use of LLMs, with 7 distinct categories; and validated advice for getting the best of LLMs for debugging and Automatic Program Repair.</p></details> |  |

Code generation not only facilitates faster prototyping and automated testing, but also augments developer efficiency through improved maintainability and reusability of code. In this paper, we introduce CodeIF, the first benchmark specifically designed to assess the abilities of LLMs to adhere to task-oriented instructions within diverse code generation scenarios. CodeIF encompasses a broad range of tasks, including function synthesis, error debugging, algorithmic refactoring, and code explanation, thereby providing a comprehensive suite to evaluate model performance across varying complexity levels and programming domains. We conduct extensive experiments with LLMs, analyzing their strengths and limitations in meeting the demands of these tasks. The experimental results offer valuable insights into how well current models align with human instructions, as well as the extent to which they can generate consistent, maintainable, and contextually relevant code.

| **[Testing the Untestable? An Empirical Study on the Testing Process of LLM-Powered Software Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00198v2)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Software systems powered by large language models are becoming a routine part of everyday technologies, supporting applications across a wide range of domains. In software engineering, many studies have focused on how LLMs support tasks such as code generation, debugging, and documentation. However, there has been limited focus on how full systems that integrate LLMs are tested during development. Aims: This study explores how LLM-powered systems are tested in the context of real-world application development. Method: We conducted an exploratory case study using 99 individual reports written by students who built and deployed LLM-powered applications as part of a university course. Each report was independently analyzed using thematic analysis, supported by a structured coding process. Results: Testing strategies combined manual and automated methods to evaluate both system logic and model behavior. Common practices included exploratory testing, unit testing, and prompt iteration. Reported challenges included integration failures, unpredictable outputs, prompt sensitivity, hallucinations, and uncertainty about correctness. Conclusions: Testing LLM-powered systems required adaptations to traditional verification methods, blending source-level reasoning with behavior-aware evaluations. These findings provide evidence on the practical context of testing generative components in software systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Screencast-Based Analysis of User-Perceived GUI Responsiveness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01337v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>GUI responsiveness is critical for a positive user experience in mobile applications. Even brief delays in visual feedback can frustrate users and lead to negative reviews. However, detecting and quantifying such user-perceived delays remains challenging, especially in industrial testing pipelines that evaluate thousands of apps daily across diverse devices and OS versions. Existing techniques based on static analysis or system metrics, while useful, may not accurately capture user-perceived issues or scale effectively. In this experience paper, we present \tool, a lightweight and black-box technique that measures GUI responsiveness directly from mobile screencasts -- video recordings captured during automated GUI testing. \tool detects user interactions and visual delays, helping developers identify GUI performance issues that affect the user experience. It uses computer vision to detect user interactions and analyzes frame-level visual changes to compute two key metrics: response time (from user action to first visual feedback) and finish time (until visual feedback stabilizes). We evaluate \tool on a manually annotated benchmark of 2,458 interactions from 64 popular Android apps. \tool achieves 0.96 precision and 0.93 recall in detecting interactions, and measures response and finish times within 50\,ms and 100\,ms error, respectively, for over 89\% of interactions. The tool has been deployed in an industrial testing pipeline and analyzes thousands of screencasts daily, uncovering responsiveness issues missed by traditional tools and improving performance debugging efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey on Code Generation with LLM-based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00083v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code generation agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing the software development paradigm. Distinct from previous code generation techniques, code generation agents are characterized by three core features. 1) Autonomy: the ability to independently manage the entire workflow, from task decomposition to coding and debugging. 2) Expanded task scope: capabilities that extend beyond generating code snippets to encompass the full software development lifecycle (SDLC). 3) Enhancement of engineering practicality: a shift in research emphasis from algorithmic innovation toward practical engineering challenges, such as system reliability, process management, and tool integration. This domain has recently witnessed rapid development and an explosion in research, demonstrating significant application potential. This paper presents a systematic survey of the field of LLM-based code generation agents. We trace the technology's developmental trajectory from its inception and systematically categorize its core techniques, including both single-agent and multi-agent architectures. Furthermore, this survey details the applications of LLM-based agents across the full SDLC, summarizes mainstream evaluation benchmarks and metrics, and catalogs representative tools. Finally, by analyzing the primary challenges, we identify and propose several foundational, long-term research directions for the future work of the field.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[Machine Learning Pipeline for Software Engineering: A Systematic Literature Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00045v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of software development practices has introduced challenges in ensuring quality and efficiency across the software engineering (SE) lifecycle. As SE systems grow in complexity, traditional approaches often fail to scale, resulting in longer debugging times, inefficient defect detection, and resource-heavy development cycles. Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a key solution, enabling automation in tasks such as defect prediction, code review, and release quality estimation. However, the effectiveness of ML in SE depends on the robustness of its pipeline, including data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, algorithm selection, validation, and evaluation. This systematic literature review (SLR) examines state-of-the-art ML pipelines designed for SE, consolidating best practices, challenges, and gaps. Our findings show that robust preprocessing, such as SMOTE for data balancing and SZZ-based algorithms for feature selection, improves model reliability. Ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting dominate performance across tasks, while simpler models such as Naive Bayes remain valuable for efficiency and interpretability. Evaluation metrics including AUC, F1-score, and precision are most common, with new metrics like Best Arithmetic Mean (BAM) emerging in niche applications. Validation techniques such as bootstrapping are widely used to ensure model stability and generalizability. This SLR highlights the importance of well-designed ML pipelines for addressing SE challenges and provides actionable insights for researchers and practitioners seeking to optimize software quality and efficiency. By identifying gaps and trends, this study sets a foundation for advancing ML adoption and fostering innovation in increasingly complex development environments.</p></details> |  |

However, ABPs may raise specific concerns including decreased stakeholder trust, difficulties in debugging, hindered accountability, risk of bias, and issues with regulatory compliance. We argue for eXplainable ABPs (XABPs) to address these concerns by enabling systems to articulate their rationale. The paper outlines a systematic approach to XABPs, characterizing their forms, structuring explainability, and identifying key BPM research challenges towards XABPs.</p></details> |  |

The ability to incorporate new IoT devices under the management of a centralized platform is an essential requirement. However, it requires significant human expertise and effort to program the complex IoT integration code that enables the platform to understand and control the device functions. Therefore, we propose AutoBridge to automate IoT integration code generation. Specifically, AutoBridge adopts a divide-and-conquer strategy: it first generates device control logic by progressively retrieving device-specific knowledge, then synthesizes platformcompliant integration code using platform-specific knowledge. To ensure correctness, AutoBridge features a multi-stage debugging pipeline, including an automated debugger for virtual IoT device testing and an interactive hardware-in-the-loop debugger that requires only binary user feedback (yes and no) for real-device verification. We evaluate AutoBridge on a benchmark of 34 IoT devices across two open-source IoT platforms. The results demonstrate that AutoBridge can achieves an average success rate of 93.87% and an average function coverage of 94.87%, without any human involvement. With minimal binary yes and no feedback from users, the code is then revised to reach 100% function coverage. A user study with 15 participants further shows that AutoBridge outperforms expert programmers by 50% to 80% in code accuracy, even when the programmers are allowed to use commercial code LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 12 figures, under review</p></details> |

Debugging remains unsolved despite these advances. While Claude Opus 4 and GPT-4.1 achieve >70% on code synthesis benchmarks, they perform <15% on real debugging tasks. We introduce Kodezi Chronos, a language model built specifically for debugging. Chronos combines Adaptive Graph-Guided Retrieval to navigate codebases up to 10 million lines using multi-hop traversal (92% precision, 85% recall), Persistent Debug Memory trained on 15M+ sessions, and a 7-layer architecture for iterative fix-test-refine loops. On 5,000 real-world scenarios, Chronos achieves 67.3% fix accuracy, compared to 14.2% and 13.8% for Claude and GPT-4.1 respectively. Chronos reduces debugging time by 40% and iteration count by 65%. It resolves complex multi-file bugs involving cross-repository context and temporal reasoning. Key limitations include 23.4% success on hardware-dependent issues and 41.2% on dynamic language errors. Theoretical analysis shows O(k log d) retrieval complexity with convergence guarantees. In a human evaluation (N=50), 89% of participants preferred Chronos over baseline models. Chronos will be available in Kodezi OS in Q4 2025 and via API in Q1 2026.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 21 figures, 37 tables, 2 algorithms.

| **[HLSDebugger: Identification and Correction of Logic Bugs in HLS Code with LLM Solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21485v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-level synthesis (HLS) accelerates hardware design by enabling the automatic translation of high-level descriptions into efficient hardware implementations. However, debugging HLS code is a challenging and labor-intensive task, especially for novice circuit designers or software engineers without sufficient hardware domain knowledge. The recent emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) is promising in automating the HLS debugging process. Despite the great potential, three key challenges persist when applying LLMs to HLS logic debugging: 1) High-quality circuit data for training LLMs is scarce, posing a significant challenge. 2) Debugging logic bugs in hardware is inherently more complex than identifying software bugs with existing golden test cases. 3) The absence of reliable test cases requires multi-tasking solutions, performing both bug identification and correction. complicates the multi-tasking required for effective HLS debugging. In this work, we propose a customized solution named HLSDebugger to address the challenges. HLSDebugger first generates and releases a large labeled dataset with 300K data samples, targeting HLS logic bugs. The HLSDebugger model adopts an encoder-decoder structure, performing bug location identification, bug type prediction, and bug correction with the same model. HLSDebugger significantly outperforms advanced LLMs like GPT-4 in bug identification and by more than 3x in bug correction. It makes a substantial advancement in the exploration of automated debugging of HLS code.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted at ICCAD 2025 (International Conference on Computer-Aided Design)</p></details> |

Traditional debugging techniques from classical software engineering cannot directly resolve this issue due to the inherently stochastic nature of quantum computation mixed with noises from NISQ computers. To address this gap, we propose a statistical approach leveraging probabilistic metrics to differentiate between quantum software bugs and hardware noise. We evaluate our methodology empirically using well-known quantum algorithms, including Grover's algorithm, Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, and Simon's algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy and practical applicability of our approach, providing quantum software developers with a reliable analytical tool to identify and classify unexpected behavior in quantum programs.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 30 figures, accepted by the IEEE International Conference on Quantum Computing and Engineering (QCE), IEEE Quantum Week, 2025</p></details> |
| **[BOOP: Write Right Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22085v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Novice programmers frequently adopt a syntax-specific and test-case-driven approach, writing code first and adjusting until programs compile and test cases pass, rather than developing correct solutions through systematic reasoning. AI coding tools exacerbate this challenge by providing syntactically correct but conceptually flawed solutions. In this paper, we introduce BOOP (Blueprint, Operations, OCaml, Proof), a structured framework requiring four mandatory phases: formal specification, language-agnostic algorithm development, implementation, and correctness proof. This shifts focus from ``making code work'' to understanding why code is correct. BOOP was implemented at our institution using a VS Code extension and preprocessor that enforces constraints and identifies counterproductive patterns. Initial evaluation shows improved algorithmic reasoning and reduced trial-and-error debugging. Students reported better edge case understanding and problem decomposition, though some initially found the format verbose. Instructors observed stronger foundational skills compared to traditional approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgentMesh: A Cooperative Multi-Agent Generative AI Framework for Software Development Automation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19902v1)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software development is a complex, multi-phase process traditionally requiring collaboration among individuals with diverse expertise. We propose AgentMesh, a Python-based framework that uses multiple cooperating LLM-powered agents to automate software development tasks. In AgentMesh, specialized agents - a Planner, Coder, Debugger, and Reviewer - work in concert to transform a high-level requirement into fully realized code. The Planner agent first decomposes user requests into concrete subtasks; the Coder agent implements each subtask in code; the Debugger agent tests and fixes the code; and the Reviewer agent validates the final output for correctness and quality. We describe the architecture and design of these agents and their communication, and provide implementation details including prompt strategies and workflow orchestration. A case study illustrates AgentMesh handling a non-trivial development request via sequential task planning, code generation, iterative debugging, and final code review. We discuss how dividing responsibilities among cooperative agents leverages the strengths of large language models while mitigating single-agent limitations. Finally, we examine current limitations - such as error propagation and context scaling - and outline future work toward more robust, scalable multi-agent AI systems for software engineering automation.</p></details> |  |
| **[SLICEMATE: Accurate and Scalable Static Program Slicing via LLM-Powered Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18957v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Static program slicing, which extracts the executable portions of a program that affect the values at a specific location, supports many software analysis tasks such as debugging and security auditing. However, traditional slicing tools rely on computationally expensive reachability analysis over dependency graphs, which struggle to scale to large programs and often fail to handle code with incomplete syntax. Recently emerged learning-based methods, while more robust to such cases, still fall short of achieving comparable performance to traditional methods on well-formed code. In this work, we propose SliceMate, a novel static program slicing solution powered by Large Language Model (LLM) agents. It bypasses the need for explicit dependency graph construction and achieving superior slicing accuracy. Concretely, SliceMate integrates three specialized agents: (1) a synthesis agent that produces candidate slices by incrementally expanding the scan scope across functions and files guided by LLM-inferred dependencies; (2) a verification agent that performs conciseness and completeness checks of the candidate slices, detecting missing or irrelevant statements; and (3) a refinement agent that repairs the slices with minimal edits in accordance with the verification results. These agents are orchestrated by a control module that ensures timely convergence and outputs high-quality slices without manual intervention. For rigorous evaluation, we construct a new and high-quality benchmark, SliceBench, comprising 2,200 manually annotated Java and Python programs, with program lengths ranging from 5 to 8,577 lines, significantly larger than those in existing slicing benchmarks. Experimental results show that SliceMate greatly outperforms both traditional and learning-based slicing tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[MemoCoder: Automated Function Synthesis using LLM-Supported Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18812v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT, developers increasingly rely on AI-assisted tools to support code generation. While LLMs can generate syntactically correct solutions for well-structured programming tasks, they often struggle with challenges that require iterative debugging, error handling, or adaptation to diverse problem structures. Existing approaches such as fine-tuning or self-repair strategies either require costly retraining or lack mechanisms to accumulate and reuse knowledge from previous attempts. To address these limitations, we propose MemoCoder, a multi-agent framework that enables collaborative problem solving and persistent learning from past fixes. At the core of MemoCoder is a Fixing Knowledge Set, which stores successful repairs and supports retrieval for future tasks. A central Mentor Agent supervises the repair process by identifying recurring error patterns and refining high-level fixing strategies, providing a novel supervisory role that guides the self-repair loop. We evaluate MemoCoder across three public benchmarks -- MBPP, HumanEval, and LiveCodeBench -- spanning a range of problem complexities. Experimental results show that MemoCoder consistently outperforms both zero-shot prompting and a Self-Repair strategy, with improvements ranging from 3.1% to 12.1% in Pass@10 and from 1.4% to 14.5% in Pass@50, demonstrating its effectiveness in iterative refinement and knowledge-guided code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeReasoner: Enhancing the Code Reasoning Ability with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17548v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code reasoning is a fundamental capability for large language models (LLMs) in the code domain. It involves understanding and predicting a program's execution behavior, such as determining the output for a given input or whether a specific statement will be executed. This capability is essential for downstream tasks like debugging, code generation, and program repair. Prior approaches mainly rely on supervised fine-tuning to improve performance in code reasoning tasks. However, they often show limited gains and fail to generalize across diverse scenarios. We argue this is due to two core issues: the low quality of training data and the limitations of supervised fine-tuning, which struggles to teach general reasoning skills. To address these challenges, we propose CodeReasoner, a framework that spans both dataset construction and a two-stage training process. First, we introduce a method to construct datasets that focus on the core execution logic of Python programs. Next, we apply instruction tuning to inject execution-specific knowledge distilled from a powerful teacher model. We then enhance reasoning and generalization through GRPO reinforcement learning on top of the fine-tuned model. Experiments on three widely-used code reasoning benchmarks show that CodeReasoner improves performance by 27.1% to 40.2% over prior methods using a 7B model. Notably, the 7B model matches GPT-4o on key tasks like input/output and coverage prediction. When scaled to 14B, CodeReasoner outperforms GPT-4o across all benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each training stage and highlight the importance of reasoning chains.</p></details> |  |
| **[AssertFlip: Reproducing Bugs via Inversion of LLM-Generated Passing Tests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17542v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bug reproduction is critical in the software debugging and repair process, yet the majority of bugs in open-source and industrial settings lack executable tests to reproduce them at the time they are reported, making diagnosis and resolution more difficult and time-consuming. To address this challenge, we introduce AssertFlip, a novel technique for automatically generating Bug Reproducible Tests (BRTs) using large language models (LLMs). Unlike existing methods that attempt direct generation of failing tests, AssertFlip first generates passing tests on the buggy behaviour and then inverts these tests to fail when the bug is present. We hypothesize that LLMs are better at writing passing tests than ones that crash or fail on purpose. Our results show that AssertFlip outperforms all known techniques in the leaderboard of SWT-Bench, a benchmark curated for BRTs. Specifically, AssertFlip achieves a fail-to-pass success rate of 43.6% on the SWT-Bench-Verified subset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Understanding the Challenges of Bug Localization in Deep Learning Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01021v2)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software bugs cost the global economy billions of dollars annually and claim ~50\% of the programming time from software developers. Locating these bugs is crucial for their resolution but challenging. It is even more challenging in deep-learning systems due to their black-box nature. Bugs in these systems are also hidden not only in the code but also in the models and training data, which might make traditional debugging methods less effective. In this article, we conduct a large-scale empirical study to better understand the challenges of localizing bugs in deep-learning systems. First, we determine the bug localization performance of four existing techniques using 2,365 bugs from deep-learning systems and 2,913 from traditional software. We found these techniques significantly underperform in localizing deep-learning system bugs. Second, we evaluate how different bug types in deep learning systems impact bug localization. We found that the effectiveness of localization techniques varies with bug type due to their unique challenges. For example, tensor bugs were more accessible to locate due to their structural nature, while all techniques struggled with GPU bugs due to their external dependencies. Third, we investigate the impact of bugs' extrinsic nature on localization in deep-learning systems. We found that deep learning bugs are often extrinsic and thus connected to artifacts other than source code (e.g., GPU, training data), contributing to the poor performance of existing localization methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Empirical Software Engineering Journal in 2025</p></details> |

A Study on Competition-Level Programming Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06821v3)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, capable of tackling complex tasks during inference. However, the extent to which LLMs can be utilized for code checking or debugging through test case generation remains largely unexplored. We investigate this problem from the perspective of competition-level programming (CP) programs and propose TCGBench, a Benchmark for (LLM generation of) Test Case Generators. This benchmark comprises two tasks, aimed at studying the capabilities of LLMs in (1) generating valid test case generators for a given CP problem, and further (2) generating targeted test case generators that expose bugs in human-written code. Experimental results indicate that while state-of-the-art LLMs can generate valid test case generators in most cases, most LLMs struggle to generate targeted test cases that reveal flaws in human code effectively. Especially, even advanced reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) fall significantly short of human performance in the task of generating targeted generators. Furthermore, we construct a high-quality, manually curated dataset of instructions for generating targeted generators. Analysis demonstrates that the performance of LLMs can be enhanced with the aid of this dataset, by both prompting and fine-tuning.</p></details> | 37 pages, 22 figures |
| **[On the Need for a Statistical Foundation in Scenario-Based Testing of Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02274v2)** | 2025-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scenario-based testing has emerged as a common method for autonomous vehicles (AVs) safety assessment, offering a more efficient alternative to mile-based testing by focusing on high-risk scenarios. However, fundamental questions persist regarding its stopping rules, residual risk estimation, debug effectiveness, and the impact of simulation fidelity on safety claims. This paper argues that a rigorous statistical foundation is essential to address these challenges and enable rigorous safety assurance. By drawing parallels between AV testing and established software testing methods, we identify shared research gaps and reusable solutions. We propose proof-of-concept models to quantify the probability of failure per scenario (\textit{pfs}) and evaluate testing effectiveness under varying conditions. Our analysis reveals that neither scenario-based nor mile-based testing universally outperforms the other. Furthermore, we give an example of formal reasoning about alignment of synthetic and real-world testing outcomes, a first step towards supporting statistically defensible simulation-based safety claims.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ITSC 2025</p></details> |

DL frameworks have traditionally embraced deferred execution-style DL code -- supporting symbolic, graph-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) computation. While scalable, such development is error-prone, non-intuitive, and difficult to debug. Consequently, more natural, imperative DL frameworks encouraging eager execution have emerged but at the expense of run-time performance. Though hybrid approaches aim for the "best of both worlds," using them effectively requires subtle considerations. Our key insight is that, while DL programs typically execute sequentially, hybridizing imperative DL code resembles parallelizing sequential code in traditional systems. Inspired by this, we present an automated refactoring approach that assists developers in determining which otherwise eagerly-executed imperative DL functions could be effectively and efficiently executed as graphs. The approach features novel static imperative tensor and side-effect analyses for Python. Due to its inherent dynamism, analyzing Python may be unsound; however, the conservative approach leverages a speculative (keyword-based) analysis for resolving difficult cases that informs developers of any assumptions made. The approach is: (i) implemented as a plug-in to the PyDev Eclipse IDE that integrates the WALA Ariadne analysis framework and (ii) evaluated on nineteen DL projects consisting of 132 KLOC. The results show that 326 of 766 candidate functions (42.56%) were refactorable, and an average relative speedup of 2.16 on performance tests was observed with negligible differences in model accuracy. The results indicate that the approach is useful in optimizing imperative DL code to its full potential.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Code Comprehension Benchmark for Large Language Models for Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10641v1)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models have shown impressive capabilities in coding tasks like code generation and code completion, as they have been trained on a large amount of code data. Also, since one of the core pretraining objectives is Next Token Prediction, these models tends to learn surface-level syntactic patterns in code. However, this does not guarantee code comprehension ability i.e. the ability to capture the semantics of the code. In our opinion, this is the reason why these models often underperform on tasks that require deeper semantic understanding, such as code debugging and code optimization. To address this, we propose fine-tuning these models specifically for code comprehension tasks using large-scale datasets, enabling them to develop a more robust understanding of code semantics. We evaluate three code models of varying sizes on a suite of code comprehension tasks designed to assess semantic understanding beyond surface-level syntactic pattern matching. In particular, we analyze performance on the Subjectivity Grading Task and observe that model performance improves after fine-tuning on relevant downstream tasks. The most significant improvement is seen in the QWQ-32B model, where accuracy increases from 70% to 83.47%. A similar or explainable trend is observed across other models, clearly indicating an enhancement in code comprehension ability. Among the models studied, the DPO-fine-tuned Codestral-22B achieves the highest micro-accuracy of 87.66% on the Subjectivity Grading Task.</p></details> | 10 Pages, 5 Figures |

We introduce the Debugging Decay Index (DDI), a mathematical framework that quantifies when debugging becomes ineffective and predicts intervention points. Our strategic fresh start approach shifts from exploitation to exploration at strategic points in the debugging process, demonstrating that well-timed interventions can rescue the effectiveness of debugging. DDI reveals a fundamental limitation in current AI debugging and provides the first quantitative framework for optimising iterative code generation strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tool for Supporting Debugging and Understanding of Normative Requirements Using LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05504v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Normative requirements specify social, legal, ethical, empathetic, and cultural (SLEEC) norms that must be observed by a system. To support the identification of SLEEC requirements, numerous standards and regulations have been developed. These requirements are typically defined by stakeholders in the non-technical system with diverse expertise (e.g., ethicists, lawyers, social scientists). Hence, ensuring their consistency and managing the requirement elicitation process are complex and error-prone tasks. Recent research has addressed this challenge using domain-specific languages to specify normative requirements as rules, whose consistency can then be analyzed with formal methods. Nevertheless, these approaches often present the results from formal verification tools in a way that is inaccessible to non-technical users. This hinders understanding and makes the iterative process of eliciting and validating these requirements inefficient in terms of both time and effort. To address this problem, we introduce SLEEC-LLM, a tool that uses large language models (LLMs) to provide natural-language interpretations for model-checking counterexamples corresponding to SLEEC rule inconsistencies. SLEEC-LLM improves the efficiency and explainability of normative requirements elicitation and consistency analysis. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we summarise its use in two real-world case studies involving non-technical stakeholders.</p></details> |  |

This is especially the case as we acknowledge the prospects of negative impacts from these technologies. Traditional software engineering methods, such as testing and debugging, have proven effective in maintaining software quality; however, they reveal significant research and practice gaps in maintaining neural networks. In particular, there is a limited understanding of how practitioners currently address challenges related to understanding and mitigating undesirable behaviors in neural networks. In our ongoing research, we explore the current state of research and practice in maintaining neural networks by curating insights from practitioners through a preliminary study involving interviews and supporting survey responses. Our findings thus far indicate that existing tools primarily concentrate on building and training models. While these tools can be beneficial, they often fall short of supporting practitioners' understanding and addressing the underlying causes of unexpected model behavior. By evaluating current procedures and identifying the limitations of traditional methodologies, our study aims to offer a developer-centric perspective on where current practices fall short and highlight opportunities for improving maintenance support in neural networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised version accepted at the HumanAISE Workshop, co-located with FSE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Specification-Guided Repair of Arithmetic Errors in Dafny Programs using LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03659v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Formal verification offers strong assurances of software correctness. However, debugging and repairing the underlying faults can be complex and time-consuming when verification fails. Automated Program Repair (APR) aims to ease this by automatically identifying and fixing faults. Traditional APR techniques often depend on test suites for validation, but these may fail to capture all scenarios. In contrast, formal specifications provide stronger correctness criteria for effective repairs. We present an innovative APR tool for Dafny, a verification-aware programming language that uses formal specifications - including pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants - as oracles for fault localization and repair. Assuming the correctness of the specifications and focusing on arithmetic bugs, we localize faults through a series of steps, which include using Hoare Logic to determine the state of each statement within the program and state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize candidate fixes. The chosen models were GPT-4o mini, Llama 3, Mistral 7B, and Llemma 7B. We evaluate our approach using DafnyBench, a benchmark of real-world Dafny programs. Our tool achieves 89.6% accuracy in fault localization, with GPT-4o mini yielding the highest repair success rate (74.18%). These results highlight the potential of combining formal reasoning with LLM-driven program synthesis for automated program repair.</p></details> |  |

By incorporating external knowledge through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and knowledge graphs, our approach aims to reduce hallucinations and increase the factual accuracy of generated responses. The system provides an interactive experience similar to ChatGPT, tailored specifically for ReservoirPy, enabling users to write, debug, and understand Python code while accessing reliable domain-specific insights. In our evaluation, while proprietary models such as ChatGPT-4o and NotebookLM performed slightly better on general knowledge questions, our model outperformed them on coding tasks and showed a significant improvement over its base model, Codestral-22B.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Impact of LLM-Assistants on Software Developer Productivity: A Systematic Literature Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03156v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model assistants (LLM-assistants) present new opportunities to transform software development. Developers are increasingly adopting these tools across tasks, including coding, testing, debugging, documentation, and design. Yet, despite growing interest, there is no synthesis of how LLM-assistants affect software developer productivity. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review of 37 peer-reviewed studies published between January 2014 and December 2024 that examine this impact. Our analysis reveals that LLM-assistants offer both considerable benefits and critical risks. Commonly reported gains include minimized code search, accelerated development, and the automation of trivial and repetitive tasks. However, studies also highlight concerns around cognitive offloading, reduced team collaboration, and inconsistent effects on code quality. While the majority of studies (92%) adopt a multi-dimensional perspective by examining at least two SPACE dimensions, reflecting increased awareness of the complexity of developer productivity, only 14% extend beyond three dimensions, indicating substantial room for more integrated evaluations. Satisfaction, Performance, and Efficiency are the most frequently investigated dimensions, whereas Communication and Activity remain underexplored. Most studies are exploratory (64%) and methodologically diverse, but lack longitudinal and team-based evaluations. This review surfaces key research gaps and provides recommendations for future research and practice. All artifacts associated with this study are publicly available at https://zenodo.org/records/15788502.</p></details> | 37 pages |
| **[Exploring Challenges in Test Mocking: Developer Questions and Insights from StackOverflow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08300v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mocking is a common unit testing technique that is used to simplify tests, reduce flakiness, and improve coverage by replacing real dependencies with simplified implementations. Despite its widespread use in Open Source Software projects, there is limited understanding of how and why developers use mocks and the challenges they face. In this collaborative study, we have analyzed 25,302 questions related to Mocking on STACKOVERFLOW to identify the challenges faced by developers. We have used Latent Dirichlet Allocation for topic modeling, identified 30 key topics, and grouped the topics into five key categories. Consequently, we analyzed the annual and relative probabilities of each category to understand the evolution of mocking-related discussions. Trend analysis reveals that category like Advanced Programming peaked between 2009 and 2012 but have since declined, while categories such as Mocking Techniques and External Services have remained consistently dominant, highlighting evolving developer priorities and ongoing technical challenges. Our findings also show an inverse relationship between a topic's popularity and its difficulty. Popular topics like Framework Selection tend to have lower difficulty and faster resolution times, while complex topics like HTTP Requests and Responses are more likely to remain unanswered and take longer to resolve. A classification of questions into How, Why, What, and Other revealed that over 70% are How questions, particularly in practical domains like file access and APIs, indicating a strong need for implementation guidance. Why questions are more prevalent in error-handling contexts, reflecting conceptual challenges in debugging, while What questions are rare and mostly tied to theoretical discussions. These insights offer valuable guidance for improving developer support, tooling, and educational content in the context of mocking and unit testing.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Feasibility of Deduplicating Compiler Bugs with Bisection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23281v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Random testing has proven to be an effective technique for compiler validation. However, the debugging of bugs identified through random testing presents a significant challenge due to the frequent occurrence of duplicate test programs that expose identical compiler bugs. The process to identify duplicates is a practical research problem known as bug deduplication. Prior methodologies for compiler bug deduplication primarily rely on program analysis to extract bug-related features for duplicate identification, which can result in substantial computational overhead and limited generalizability. This paper investigates the feasibility of employing bisection, a standard debugging procedure largely overlooked in prior research on compiler bug deduplication, for this purpose. Our study demonstrates that the utilization of bisection to locate failure-inducing commits provides a valuable criterion for deduplication, albeit one that requires supplementary techniques for more accurate identification. Building on these results, we introduce BugLens, a novel deduplication method that primarily uses bisection, enhanced by the identification of bug-triggering optimizations to minimize false negatives. Empirical evaluations conducted on four real-world datasets demonstrate that BugLens significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art analysis-based methodologies Tamer and D3 by saving an average of 26.98% and 9.64% human effort to identify the same number of distinct bugs. Given the inherent simplicity and generalizability of bisection, it presents a highly practical solution for compiler bug deduplication in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

It allows verifying that the students correctly apply the features and concepts they are taught, or finding students' misconceptions. However, existing data collection tools have limitations, e.g., no control over the granularity of the collected code, not collecting the specific events of the programming environment used, and overall being hard to configure. To overcome these limitations, we propose KOALA, a convenient and highly configurable tool for collecting code snapshots and feature usage from students solving programming tasks in JetBrains IDEs. The plugin can be installed in IDEs and configured to provide the students with the necessary tasks, enable or disable certain IDE features like code completion, and run surveys. During problem solving, the plugin collects code snapshots at the configured granularity, all IDE actions like running and debugging, as well as some data not collected in prior works, like employed hotkeys and switching focus between files. The collected data is sent to the server that comes with the tool, where it is stored and can be converted to the standardized ProgSnap2 format. To showcase the tool, we collected data from 28 students solving tasks in two courses within the IDE, highlighting some insights from this data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CompEd'25, 7 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[$T^3$: Multi-level Tree-based Automatic Program Repair with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21211v1)** | 2025-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic Program Repair (APR) is a core technology in software development and maintenance, with aims to enable automated defect repair with minimal human intervention. In recent years, the substantial advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques have significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of these models. However, due to the complex logic and multi-step reasoning ability needed, the application of CoT techniques in the APR domain remains insufficient. This study systematically evaluates the performance of several common CoT techniques in APR tasks and proposes an innovative framework $T^3$, which integrates the powerful reasoning capabilities of LLMs with tree search, effectively improving the precision of generating candidate repair solutions. Furthermore, $T^3$ provides valuable guidance for optimizing sample selection and repair strategies in APR tasks, establishing a robust framework for achieving efficient automated debugging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Various Software Artifacts for Better LLM-based Bug Localization and Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03905v3)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have garnered considerable attention for their potential to streamline Automated Program Repair (APR). LLM-based approaches can either insert the correct code or directly generate patches when provided with buggy methods. However, most of LLM-based APR methods rely on a single type of software information, without fully leveraging different software artifacts. Despite this, many LLM-based approaches do not explore which specific types of information best assist in APR. Addressing this gap is crucial for advancing LLM-based APR techniques. We propose DEVLoRe to use issue content (description and message) and stack error traces to localize buggy methods, then rely on debug information in buggy methods and issue content and stack error to localize buggy lines and generate plausible patches which can pass all unit tests. The results show that while issue content is particularly effective in assisting LLMs with fault localization and program repair, different types of software artifacts complement each other. By incorporating different artifacts, DEVLoRe successfully locates 49.3% and 47.6% of single and non-single buggy methods and generates 56.0% and 14.5% plausible patches for the Defects4J v2.0 dataset, respectively. This outperforms current state-of-the-art APR methods. Furthermore, we re-implemented and evaluated our framework, demonstrating its effectiveness in its effectiveness in resolving 9 unique issues compared to other state-of-the-art frameworks using the same or more advanced models on SWE-bench Lite.We also discussed whether a leading framework for Python code can be directly applied to Java code, or vice versa.

Scale and maintain software systems are based on code refactoring. However, this process is still labor intensive, as it requires programmers to analyze the codebases in detail to avoid introducing new defects. In this research, we put forward a large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent system to automate the refactoring process on Haskell code. The objective of this research is to evaluate the effect of LLM-based agents in performing structured and semantically accurate refactoring on Haskell code. Our proposed multi-agent system based on specialized agents with distinct roles, including code analysis, refactoring execution, verification, and debugging. To test the effectiveness and practical applicability of the multi-agent system, we conducted evaluations using different open-source Haskell codebases. The results of the experiments carried out showed that the proposed LLM-based multi-agent system could average 11.03% decreased complexity in code, an improvement of 22.46% in overall code quality, and increase performance efficiency by an average of 13.27%. Furthermore, memory allocation was optimized by up to 14.57%. These results highlight the ability of LLM-based multi-agent in managing refactoring tasks targeted toward functional programming paradigms. Our findings hint that LLM-based multi-agent systems integration into the refactoring of functional programming languages can enhance maintainability and support automated development workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2502.07928</p></details> |
| **[Black-Box Test Code Fault Localization Driven by Large Language Models and Execution Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19045v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fault localization (FL) is a critical step in debugging which typically relies on repeated executions to pinpoint faulty code regions. However, repeated executions can be impractical in the presence of non-deterministic failures or high execution costs. While recent efforts have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to aid execution-free FL, these have primarily focused on identifying faults in the system under test (SUT) rather than in the often complex system test code. However, the latter is also important as, in practice, many failures are triggered by faulty test code. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a fully static, LLM-driven approach for system test code fault localization (TCFL) that does not require executing the test case. Our method uses a single failure execution log to estimate the test's execution trace through three novel algorithms that identify only code statements likely involved in the failure. This pruned trace, combined with the error message, is used to prompt the LLM to rank potential faulty locations. Our black-box, system-level approach requires no access to the SUT source code and is applicable to large test scripts that assess full system behavior. We evaluate our technique at function, block, and line levels using an industrial dataset of faulty test cases not previously used in pre-training LLMs. Results show that our best estimated trace closely match actual traces, with an F1 score of around 90%. Additionally, pruning the complex system test code reduces the LLM's inference time by up to 34% without any loss in FL performance. Our results further suggest that block-level TCFL offers a practical balance, narrowing the search space while preserving useful context, achieving an 81% hit rate at top-3 (Hit@3).</p></details> |  |
| **[Bloch Vector Assertions for Debugging Quantum Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18458v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum programs must be reliable to ensure trustworthy results, yet debugging them is notoriously challenging due to quantum-specific faults like gate misimplementations and hardware noise, as well as their inherently probabilistic nature. Assertion-based debugging provides a promising solution by enabling localized correctness checks during execution. However, current approaches face challenges including manual assertion generation, reliance on mid-circuit-measurements, and poor scalability. In this paper, we present Bloq, a scalable, automated fault localization approach introducing Bloch-vector-based assertions utilizing expectation value measurements of Pauli operators, enabling low-overhead fault localization without mid-circuit measurements. In addition, we introduce AutoBloq, a component of Bloq for automatically generating assertion schemes from quantum algorithms. An experimental evaluation over 684432 programs using two algorithms (Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) and Grover) shows that Bloq consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approach Proq, notably as circuit depth and noise increase. For Grover, Bloq achieves a mean F1 score across all experimental instances of 0.74 versus 0.38 for Proq under ideal conditions, and maintains performance under noise (0.43 versus 0.06). Bloq also reduces Proq's runtime by a factor of 5 and circuit depth overhead by a factor of 23. These results underline Bloq's potential to make assertion-based debugging scalable and effective for near-term quantum devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal Submission, 40 pages</p></details> |

However, current approaches often face challenges in computational efficiency and lack robust mechanisms for code parsing and error correction. In this work, we propose a novel framework, PyCapsule, with a simple yet effective two-agent pipeline and efficient self-debugging modules for Python code generation. PyCapsule features sophisticated prompt inference, iterative error handling, and case testing, ensuring high generation stability, safety, and correctness. Empirically, PyCapsule achieves up to 5.7% improvement of success rate on HumanEval, 10.3% on HumanEval-ET, and 24.4% on BigCodeBench compared to the state-of-art methods. We also observe a decrease in normalized success rate given more self-debugging attempts, potentially affected by limited and noisy error feedback in retention. PyCapsule demonstrates broader impacts on advancing lightweight and efficient code generation for artificial intelligence systems.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes ChatDBG, an AI-powered debugging assistant. ChatDBG integrates large language models (LLMs) to significantly enhance the capabilities and user-friendliness of conventional debuggers. ChatDBG lets programmers engage in a collaborative dialogue with the debugger, allowing them to pose complex questions about program state, perform root cause analysis for crashes or assertion failures, and explore open-ended queries like "why is x null?". To handle these queries, ChatDBG grants the LLM autonomy to "take the wheel": it can act as an independent agent capable of querying and controlling the debugger to navigate through stacks and inspect program state. It then reports its findings and yields back control to the programmer. By leveraging the real-world knowledge embedded in LLMs, ChatDBG can diagnose issues identifiable only through the use of domain-specific reasoning. Our ChatDBG prototype integrates with standard debuggers including LLDB and GDB for native code and Pdb for Python. Our evaluation across a diverse set of code, including C/C++ code with known bugs and a suite of Python code including standalone scripts and Jupyter notebooks, demonstrates that ChatDBG can successfully analyze root causes, explain bugs, and generate accurate fixes for a wide range of real-world errors. For the Python programs, a single query led to an actionable bug fix 67% of the time; one additional follow-up query increased the success rate to 85%. ChatDBG has seen rapid uptake; it has already been downloaded more than 75,000 times.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, https://doi.org/10.1145/3729355</p></details> |

GPS treats the task of model checking a program as a directed search of the program states, guided by a compositional, summary-based static analysis. The summaries produced by static analysis are used both to prune away infeasible paths and to drive test generation to reach new, unexplored program states. GPS can find both proofs of safety and counter-examples to safety (i.e., inputs that trigger bugs), and features a novel two-layered search strategy that renders it particularly efficient at finding bugs in programs featuring long, input-dependent error paths. To make GPS refutationally complete (in the sense that it will find an error if one exists, if it is allotted enough time), we introduce an instrumentation technique and show that it helps GPS achieve refutation-completeness without sacrificing overall performance. We benchmarked GPS on a suite of benchmarks including both programs from the Software Verification Competition (SV-COMP) and from prior literature, and found that our implementation of GPS outperforms state-of-the-art software model checkers (including the top performers in SV-COMP ReachSafety-Loops category), both in terms of the number of benchmarks solved and in terms of running time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of paper in OOPSLA 2025 (with updated evaluations section compared to v1 manuscript). 37 pages</p></details> |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in mitigating this effort, existing LLM-based automated debugging methods underperform on industrial-scale modules. A major reason for this is bug signal dilution in long contexts, where a few bug-relevant tokens are overwhelmed by hundreds of unrelated lines, diffusing the model's attention. To address this issue, we introduce ARSP, a two-stage system that mitigates dilution via semantics-guided fragmentation. A Partition LLM splits a module into semantically tight fragments; a Repair LLM patches each fragment; edits are merged without altering unrelated logic. A synthetic data framework generates fragment-level training pairs spanning bug types, design styles, and scales to supervise both models. Experiments show that ARSP achieves 77.92% pass@1 and 83.88% pass@5, outperforming mainstream commercial LLMs including Claude-3.7 and SOTA automated Verilog debugging tools Strider and MEIC. Also, semantic partitioning improves pass@1 by 11.6% and pass@5 by 10.2% over whole-module debugging, validating the effectiveness of fragment-level scope reduction in LLM-based Verilog debugging.</p></details> |  |

Empirical Evidence of Quantized Small Language Models for Automated Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16499v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved the accuracy of automated program repair (APR) methods. However, LLMs are constrained by high computational resource requirements. Aims: We focus on small language models (SLMs), which perform well even with limited computational resources compared to LLMs. We aim to evaluate whether SLMs can achieve competitive performance in APR tasks. Method: We conducted experiments on the QuixBugs benchmark to compare the bug-fixing accuracy of SLMs and LLMs. We also analyzed the impact of int8 quantization on APR performance. Results: The latest SLMs can fix bugs as accurately as--or even more accurately than--LLMs. Also, int8 quantization had minimal effect on APR accuracy while significantly reducing memory requirements. Conclusions: SLMs present a viable alternative to LLMs for APR, offering competitive accuracy with lower computational costs, and quantization can further enhance their efficiency without compromising effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

Yet, their real-world effectiveness in detecting diverse software bugs, particularly complex, security-relevant vulnerabilities, remains underexplored. This study presents a systematic, empirical evaluation of these three leading LLMs using a benchmark of foundational programming errors, classic security flaws, and advanced, production-grade bugs in C++ and Python. The dataset integrates real code from SEED Labs, OpenSSL (via the Suresoft GLaDOS database), and PyBugHive, validated through local compilation and testing pipelines. A novel multi-stage, context-aware prompting protocol simulates realistic debugging scenarios, while a graded rubric measures detection accuracy, reasoning depth, and remediation quality. Our results show that all models excel at identifying syntactic and semantic issues in well-scoped code, making them promising for educational use and as first-pass reviewers in automated code auditing. Performance diminishes in scenarios involving complex security vulnerabilities and large-scale production code, with ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3 generally providing more nuanced contextual analyses than LLaMA 4. This highlights both the promise and the present constraints of LLMs in serving as reliable code analysis tools.</p></details> |  |

Despite the popularity of MSA in the software industry, there is a limited evidence-based and thorough understanding of the types of issues (e.g., errors, faults, failures, and bugs) that microservices system developers experience, the causes of the issues, and the solutions as potential fixing strategies to address the issues. To ameliorate this gap, we conducted a mixed-methods empirical study that collected data from 2,641 issues from the issue tracking systems of 15 open-source microservices systems on GitHub, 15 interviews, and an online survey completed by 150 practitioners from 42 countries across 6 continents. Our analysis led to comprehensive taxonomies for the issues, causes, and solutions. The findings of this study informthat Technical Debt, Continuous Integration and Delivery, Exception Handling, Service Execution and Communication, and Security are the most dominant issues in microservices systems. Furthermore, General Programming Errors, Missing Features and Artifacts, and Invalid Configuration and Communication are the main causes behind the issues. Finally, we found 177 types of solutions that can be applied to fix the identified issues. Based on our study results, we formulated future research directions that could help researchers and practitioners to engineer emergent and next-generation microservices systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 5 images, 7 tables, Manuscript submitted to a Journal (2025)</p></details> |

However, despite their strengths in test data generation, these tools are constrained by the types of test oracles they support, often limited to crashes, regressions, and noncompliance with API specifications or design standards. This paper introduces SATORI (Static API Test ORacle Inference), a black-box approach for generating test oracles for REST APIs by analyzing their OpenAPI Specification. SATORI uses large language models to infer the expected behavior of an API by analyzing the properties of the response fields of its operations, such as their name and descriptions. To foster its adoption, we extended the PostmanAssertify tool to automatically convert the test oracles reported by SATORI into executable assertions. Evaluation results on 17 operations from 12 industrial APIs show that SATORI can automatically generate up to hundreds of valid test oracles per operation. SATORI achieved an F1-score of 74.3%, outperforming the state-of-the-art dynamic approach AGORA+ (69.3%)-which requires executing the API-when generating comparable oracle types. Moreover, our findings show that static and dynamic oracle inference methods are complementary: together, SATORI and AGORA+ found 90% of the oracles in our annotated ground-truth dataset. Notably, SATORI uncovered 18 bugs in popular APIs (Amadeus Hotel, Deutschebahn, FDIC, GitLab, Marvel, OMDb and Vimeo) leading to documentation updates by the API maintainers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, ASE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Metamorphic Coverage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16307v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metamorphic testing is a widely used methodology that examines an expected relation between pairs of executions to automatically find bugs, such as correctness bugs. We found that code coverage cannot accurately measure the extent to which code is validated and mutation testing is computationally expensive for evaluating metamorphic testing methods. In this work, we propose Metamorphic Coverage (MC), a coverage metric that examines the distinct code executed by pairs of test inputs within metamorphic testing. Our intuition is that, typically, a bug can be observed if the corresponding code is executed when executing either test input but not the other one, so covering more differential code covered by pairs of test inputs might be more likely to expose bugs. While most metamorphic testing methods have been based on this general intuition, our work defines and systematically evaluates MC on five widely used metamorphic testing methods for testing database engines, compilers, and constraint solvers. The code measured by MC overlaps with the bug-fix locations of 50 of 64 bugs found by metamorphic testing methods, and MC has a stronger positive correlation with bug numbers than line coverage. MC is 4x more sensitive than line coverage in distinguishing testing methods' effectiveness, and the average value of MC is 6x smaller than line coverage while still capturing the part of the program that is being tested. MC required 359x less time than mutation testing. Based on a case study for an automated database system testing approach, we demonstrate that when used for feedback guidance, MC significantly outperforms code coverage, by finding 41\% more bugs. Consequently, this work might have broad applications for assessing metamorphic testing methods and improving test-case generation.</p></details> |  |

Hooks are a set of APIs that manage side effects in function components in React. However, their semantics are often seen as opaque to developers, leading to UI bugs. We introduce React-tRace, a formalization of the semantics of the essence of React Hooks, providing a semantics that clarifies their behavior. We demonstrate that our model captures the behavior of React, by theoretically showing that it embodies essential properties of Hooks and empirically comparing our React-tRace-definitional interpreter against a test suite. Furthermore, we showcase a practical visualization tool based on the formalization to demonstrate how developers can better understand the semantics of Hooks.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in OOPSLA2 2025</p></details> |

| **[A Novel Mutation Based Method for Detecting FPGA Logic Synthesis Tool Bugs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15536v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) logic synthesis tools are key components in the EDA (Electronic Design Automation) toolchain. They convert hardware designs written in description languages such as Verilog into gate-level representations for FPGAs. However, defects in these tools may lead to unexpected behaviors and pose security risks. Therefore, it is crucial to harden these tools through testing. Although several methods have been proposed to automatically test FPGA logic synthesis tools, the challenge remains of insufficient semantic and logical complexity in test programs. In this paper, we propose VERMEI, a new method for testing FPGA logic synthesis tools. VERMEI consists of three modules: preprocessing, equivalent mutation, and bug identification. The preprocessing module identifies zombie logic (inactive code with no impact on the circuit output) in seed programs through simulation and coverage analysis. The equivalent mutation module generates equivalent variants of seed programs by pruning or inserting logic fragments in zombie areas. It uses Bayesian sampling to extract logic fragments from historical Verilog designs, making the generated variants have complex control flows and structures. The bug identification module, based on differential testing, compares the synthesized outputs of seed and variant programs to identify bugs. Experiments on Yosys, Vivado, and Quartus demonstrate that VERMEI outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Within five months, VERMEI reported 15 bugs to vendors, 9 of which were confirmed as new.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the need to perform comprehensive evaluations of automated program repair benchmarks: Sorald case study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15135v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In supporting the development of high-quality software, especially necessary in the era of LLMs, automated program repair (APR) tools aim to improve code quality by automatically addressing violations detected by static analysis profilers. Previous research tends to evaluate APR tools only for their ability to clear violations, neglecting their potential introduction of new (sometimes severe) violations, changes to code functionality and degrading of code structure. There is thus a need for research to develop and assess comprehensive evaluation frameworks for APR tools. This study addresses this research gap, and evaluates Sorald (a state-of-the-art APR tool) as a proof of concept. Sorald's effectiveness was evaluated in repairing 3,529 SonarQube violations across 30 rules within 2,393 Java code snippets extracted from Stack Overflow. Outcomes show that while Sorald fixes specific rule violations, it introduced 2,120 new faults (32 bugs, 2088 code smells), reduced code functional correctness--as evidenced by a 24% unit test failure rate--and degraded code structure, demonstrating the utility of our framework. Findings emphasize the need for evaluation methodologies that capture the full spectrum of APR tool effects, including side effects, to ensure their safe and effective adoption.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing the Quality and Security of AI-Generated Code: A Quantitative Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14727v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a quantitative evaluation of the code quality and security of five prominent Large Language Models (LLMs): Claude Sonnet 4, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4o, Llama 3.2 90B, and OpenCoder 8B. While prior research has assessed the functional performance of LLM-generated code, this research tested LLM output from 4,442 Java coding assignments through comprehensive static analysis using SonarQube. The findings suggest that although LLMs can generate functional code, they also introduce a range of software defects, including bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code smells. These defects do not appear to be isolated; rather, they may represent shared weaknesses stemming from systemic limitations within current LLM code generation methods. In particular, critically severe issues, such as hard-coded passwords and path traversal vulnerabilities, were observed across multiple models. These results indicate that LLM-generated code requires verification in order to be considered production-ready. This study found no direct correlation between a model's functional performance (measured by Pass@1 rate of unit tests) and the overall quality and security of its generated code, measured by the number of SonarQube issues in benchmark solutions that passed the functional tests. This suggests that functional benchmark performance score is not a good indicator of overall code quality and security. The goal of this study is not to rank LLM performance but to highlight that all evaluated models appear to share certain weaknesses. Consequently, these findings support the view that static analysis can be a valuable instrument for detecting latent defects and an important safeguard for organizations that deploy AI in software development.</p></details> |  |

Software today is often "illegible" - lacking a direct correspondence between code and observed behavior - and insufficiently modular, leading to a failure of three key requirements of robust coding: incrementality (the ability to deliver small increments by making localized changes), integrity (avoiding breaking prior increments) and transparency (making clear what has changed at build time, and what actions have happened at runtime). A new structural pattern offers improved legibility and modularity. Its elements are concepts and synchronizations: fully independent services and event-based rules that mediate between them. A domain-specific language for synchronizations allows behavioral features to be expressed in a granular and declarative way (and thus readily generated by an LLM). A case study of the RealWorld benchmark is used to illustrate and evaluate the approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages.

The standard way that PBT users generate test inputs is via generators that describe how to sample test inputs through random choices. To achieve a good distribution over test inputs, users must tune their generators, i.e., decide on the weights of these individual random choices. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to understand how to choose individual generator weights in order to achieve a desired distribution, so today this process is tedious and limits the distributions that can be practically achieved. In this paper, we develop techniques for the automatic and offline tuning of generators. Given a generator with undetermined symbolic weights and an objective function, our approach automatically learns values for these weights that optimize for the objective. We describe useful objective functions that allow users to (1) target desired distributions and (2) improve the diversity and validity of their test cases. We have implemented our approach in a novel discrete probabilistic programming system, Loaded Dice, that supports differentiation and parameter learning, and use it as a language for generators. We empirically demonstrate that our approach is effective at optimizing generator distributions according to the specified objective functions. We also perform a thorough evaluation on PBT benchmarks, demonstrating that, when automatically tuned for diversity and validity, the generators exhibit a 3.1-7.4x speedup in bug finding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of OOPSLA '25 paper</p></details> |

Within a short period, thousands of MCP services have already been developed and deployed. However, the client-server integration architecture inherent in MCP may expand the attack surface against LLM Agent systems, introducing new vulnerabilities that allow attackers to exploit by designing malicious MCP servers. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of attack vectors targeting the MCP ecosystem. Our analysis identifies four categories of attacks, i.e., Tool Poisoning Attacks, Puppet Attacks, Rug Pull Attacks, and Exploitation via Malicious External Resources. To evaluate the feasibility of these attacks, we conduct experiments following the typical steps of launching an attack through malicious MCP servers: upload-download-attack. Specifically, we first construct malicious MCP servers and successfully upload them to three widely used MCP aggregation platforms. The results indicate that current audit mechanisms are insufficient to identify and prevent the proposed attack methods. Next, through a user study and interview with 20 participants, we demonstrate that users struggle to identify malicious MCP servers and often unknowingly install them from aggregator platforms. Finally, we demonstrate that these attacks can trigger harmful behaviors within the user's local environment-such as accessing private files or controlling devices to transfer digital assets-by deploying a proof-of-concept (PoC) framework against five leading LLMs. Additionally, based on interview results, we discuss four key challenges faced by the current security ecosystem surrounding MCP servers. These findings underscore the urgent need for robust security mechanisms to defend against malicious MCP servers.</p></details> |  |

Existing analysis identifies possible contentions between parallel tasks by leveraging the partial order of the tasks or their program regions. Unfortunately, they overestimate the number of cache misses caused by a remote block access without considering the actual cache state and the number of accesses. This paper reports a new analysis for inter-core cache contention. Based on the order of program regions in a task, we first identify memory references that could be affected if a remote access occurs in a region. Afterwards, a fine-grained contention analysis is constructed that computes the number of cache misses based on the access quantity of local and remote blocks. We demonstrate that the overall inter-core cache interference of a task can be obtained via dynamic programming. Experiments show that compared to existing methods, the proposed analysis reduces inter-core cache interference and WCET estimations by 52.31% and 8.94% on average, without significantly increasing computation overhead.</p></details> |  |

GPS treats the task of model checking a program as a directed search of the program states, guided by a compositional, summary-based static analysis. The summaries produced by static analysis are used both to prune away infeasible paths and to drive test generation to reach new, unexplored program states. GPS can find both proofs of safety and counter-examples to safety (i.e., inputs that trigger bugs), and features a novel two-layered search strategy that renders it particularly efficient at finding bugs in programs featuring long, input-dependent error paths. To make GPS refutationally complete (in the sense that it will find an error if one exists, if it is allotted enough time), we introduce an instrumentation technique and show that it helps GPS achieve refutation-completeness without sacrificing overall performance. We benchmarked GPS on a suite of benchmarks including both programs from the Software Verification Competition (SV-COMP) and from prior literature, and found that our implementation of GPS outperforms state-of-the-art software model checkers (including the top performers in SV-COMP ReachSafety-Loops category), both in terms of the number of benchmarks solved and in terms of running time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of paper in OOPSLA 2025 (with updated evaluations section compared to v1 manuscript). 37 pages</p></details> |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in mitigating this effort, existing LLM-based automated debugging methods underperform on industrial-scale modules. A major reason for this is bug signal dilution in long contexts, where a few bug-relevant tokens are overwhelmed by hundreds of unrelated lines, diffusing the model's attention. To address this issue, we introduce ARSP, a two-stage system that mitigates dilution via semantics-guided fragmentation. A Partition LLM splits a module into semantically tight fragments; a Repair LLM patches each fragment; edits are merged without altering unrelated logic. A synthetic data framework generates fragment-level training pairs spanning bug types, design styles, and scales to supervise both models. Experiments show that ARSP achieves 77.92% pass@1 and 83.88% pass@5, outperforming mainstream commercial LLMs including Claude-3.7 and SOTA automated Verilog debugging tools Strider and MEIC. Also, semantic partitioning improves pass@1 by 11.6% and pass@5 by 10.2% over whole-module debugging, validating the effectiveness of fragment-level scope reduction in LLM-based Verilog debugging.</p></details> |  |

Empirical Evidence of Quantized Small Language Models for Automated Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16499v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved the accuracy of automated program repair (APR) methods. However, LLMs are constrained by high computational resource requirements. Aims: We focus on small language models (SLMs), which perform well even with limited computational resources compared to LLMs. We aim to evaluate whether SLMs can achieve competitive performance in APR tasks. Method: We conducted experiments on the QuixBugs benchmark to compare the bug-fixing accuracy of SLMs and LLMs. We also analyzed the impact of int8 quantization on APR performance. Results: The latest SLMs can fix bugs as accurately as--or even more accurately than--LLMs. Also, int8 quantization had minimal effect on APR accuracy while significantly reducing memory requirements. Conclusions: SLMs present a viable alternative to LLMs for APR, offering competitive accuracy with lower computational costs, and quantization can further enhance their efficiency without compromising effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

Yet, their real-world effectiveness in detecting diverse software bugs, particularly complex, security-relevant vulnerabilities, remains underexplored. This study presents a systematic, empirical evaluation of these three leading LLMs using a benchmark of foundational programming errors, classic security flaws, and advanced, production-grade bugs in C++ and Python. The dataset integrates real code from SEED Labs, OpenSSL (via the Suresoft GLaDOS database), and PyBugHive, validated through local compilation and testing pipelines. A novel multi-stage, context-aware prompting protocol simulates realistic debugging scenarios, while a graded rubric measures detection accuracy, reasoning depth, and remediation quality. Our results show that all models excel at identifying syntactic and semantic issues in well-scoped code, making them promising for educational use and as first-pass reviewers in automated code auditing. Performance diminishes in scenarios involving complex security vulnerabilities and large-scale production code, with ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3 generally providing more nuanced contextual analyses than LLaMA 4. This highlights both the promise and the present constraints of LLMs in serving as reliable code analysis tools.</p></details> |  |

Despite impressive progress on existing benchmarks, we argue that current evaluations overstate model proficiency, masking a substantial gap between LLMs and elite human programmers. This gap arises from two key limitations: insufficient difficulty and scope of benchmark problems, and evaluation bias from low-quality test cases. To address these shortcomings, we present AetherCode, a new benchmark that draws problems from premier programming competitions such as IOI and ICPC, offering broader coverage and higher difficulty. AetherCode further incorporates comprehensive, expert-validated test suites built through a hybrid of automated generation and human curation, ensuring rigorous and reliable assessment. By combining challenging problem design with robust evaluation, AetherCode provides a more faithful measure of LLM capabilities and sets a new standard for future research in code reasoning.</p></details> | 15 pages |

Despite the popularity of MSA in the software industry, there is a limited evidence-based and thorough understanding of the types of issues (e.g., errors, faults, failures, and bugs) that microservices system developers experience, the causes of the issues, and the solutions as potential fixing strategies to address the issues. To ameliorate this gap, we conducted a mixed-methods empirical study that collected data from 2,641 issues from the issue tracking systems of 15 open-source microservices systems on GitHub, 15 interviews, and an online survey completed by 150 practitioners from 42 countries across 6 continents. Our analysis led to comprehensive taxonomies for the issues, causes, and solutions. The findings of this study informthat Technical Debt, Continuous Integration and Delivery, Exception Handling, Service Execution and Communication, and Security are the most dominant issues in microservices systems. Furthermore, General Programming Errors, Missing Features and Artifacts, and Invalid Configuration and Communication are the main causes behind the issues. Finally, we found 177 types of solutions that can be applied to fix the identified issues. Based on our study results, we formulated future research directions that could help researchers and practitioners to engineer emergent and next-generation microservices systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 5 images, 7 tables, Manuscript submitted to a Journal (2025)</p></details> |
| **[Metamorphic Coverage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16307v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metamorphic testing is a widely used methodology that examines an expected relation between pairs of executions to automatically find bugs, such as correctness bugs. We found that code coverage cannot accurately measure the extent to which code is validated and mutation testing is computationally expensive for evaluating metamorphic testing methods. In this work, we propose Metamorphic Coverage (MC), a coverage metric that examines the distinct code executed by pairs of test inputs within metamorphic testing. Our intuition is that, typically, a bug can be observed if the corresponding code is executed when executing either test input but not the other one, so covering more differential code covered by pairs of test inputs might be more likely to expose bugs. While most metamorphic testing methods have been based on this general intuition, our work defines and systematically evaluates MC on five widely used metamorphic testing methods for testing database engines, compilers, and constraint solvers. The code measured by MC overlaps with the bug-fix locations of 50 of 64 bugs found by metamorphic testing methods, and MC has a stronger positive correlation with bug numbers than line coverage. MC is 4x more sensitive than line coverage in distinguishing testing methods' effectiveness, and the average value of MC is 6x smaller than line coverage while still capturing the part of the program that is being tested. MC required 359x less time than mutation testing. Based on a case study for an automated database system testing approach, we demonstrate that when used for feedback guidance, MC significantly outperforms code coverage, by finding 41\% more bugs. Consequently, this work might have broad applications for assessing metamorphic testing methods and improving test-case generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Fools are Certain; the Wise are Doubtful: Exploring LLM Confidence in Code Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16131v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code completion entails the task of providing missing tokens given a surrounding context. It can boost developer productivity while providing a powerful code discovery tool. Following the Large Language Model (LLM) wave, code completion has been approached with diverse LLMs fine-tuned on code (code LLMs). The performance of code LLMs can be assessed with downstream and intrinsic metrics. Downstream metrics are usually employed to evaluate the practical utility of a model, but can be unreliable and require complex calculations and domain-specific knowledge. In contrast, intrinsic metrics such as perplexity, entropy, and mutual information, which measure model confidence or uncertainty, are simple, versatile, and universal across LLMs and tasks, and can serve as proxies for functional correctness and hallucination risk in LLM-generated code. Motivated by this, we evaluate the confidence of LLMs when generating code by measuring code perplexity across programming languages, models, and datasets using various LLMs, and a sample of 1008 files from 657 GitHub projects. We find that strongly-typed languages exhibit lower perplexity than dynamically typed languages. Scripting languages also demonstrate higher perplexity. Perl appears universally high in perplexity, whereas Java appears low. Code perplexity depends on the employed LLM, but not on the code dataset. Although code comments often increase perplexity, the language ranking based on perplexity is barely affected by their presence. LLM researchers, developers, and users can employ our findings to assess the benefits and suitability of LLM-based code completion in specific software projects based on how language, model choice, and code characteristics impact model confidence.</p></details> | 30 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Leveraging Large Language Models to Detect Missed Peephole Optimizations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16125v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By replacing small, suboptimal instruction sequences within programs with a more efficient equivalent, peephole optimization can not only directly optimize code size and performance, but also potentially enables further transformations in the subsequent optimization pipeline. Although peephole optimization is a critical class of compiler optimizations, discovering new and effective peephole optimizations is challenging as the instruction sets can be extremely complex and diverse. Previous methods either do not scale well or can only capture a limited subset of peephole optimizations. In this work, we leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect missed peephole optimizations. We propose Lampo, a novel automated framework that synergistically combines the creative but unreliable code optimization ability of LLMs with rigorous correctness verification performed by translation validation tools, integrated in a feedback-driven iterative process. Through a comprehensive evaluation within LLVM ecosystems, we show that Lampo can successfully detect up to 17 out of 25 previously reported missed optimizations in LLVM on average, and that 22 out of 25 can potentially be found by Lampo with different LLMs. For comparison, the state-of-the-art superoptimizer for LLVM, Souper, identified 15 of them. Moreover, within seven months of development and intermittent experiments, Lampo found 26 missed peephole optimizations, 15 of which have been confirmed and 6 already fixed. These results demonstrate Lampo's strong potential in continuously detecting missed peephole optimizations.</p></details> |  |

We combine various techniques from the literature to achieve this. Our experiments show that our approach performs better than other techniques on standard benchmarks. However, on closer inspection, none of these techniques work on realistic defects that we see in industry. We find that augmenting code with formal specifications enables LLMs to generate higher-quality unit tests, especially for complex production code with improved coverage of edge cases and exception handling. However, specifications add little value for well-understood errors (e.g., null pointer, index out of bounds), but are beneficial for logic and string manipulation errors. Despite encouraging benchmark results, real-world adoption is limited since passing tests do not guarantee correct patches. Current challenges include insufficient expressiveness of the JML specification language, necessitating advanced verification tools and richer predicates. Our ongoing work is exploring contract automata, programming by example, and testcase repair, with a focus on integrating human feedback and measuring productivity gains - highlighting the gap between academic benchmarks and practical industry needs</p></details> |  |

Current methods on PCR mainly focus on the reviewer's perspective, including finding a capable reviewer, predicting comment quality, and recommending/generating review comments. However, it is not well studied that how to satisfy the review necessity requests posted by developers which can increase their visibility, which in turn acts as a prerequisite for better review responses. To this end, we propose K nowledge-guided P rompt learning for P ublic Code Review (KP-PCR) to achieve developer-based code review request quality assurance (i.e., predicting request necessity and recommending tags subtask). Specifically, we reformulate the two subtasks via 1) text prompt tuning which converts both of them into a Masked Language Model (MLM) by constructing prompt templates using hard prompt; and 2) knowledge and code prefix tuning which introduces knowledge guidance from fine-tuned large language models by soft prompt, and uses program dependence graph to characterize code snippets. Finally, both of the request necessity prediction and tag recommendation subtasks output predicted results through an answer engineering module. In addition, we further analysis the time complexity of our KP-PCR that has lightweight prefix based the operation of introducing knowledge guidance. Experimental results on the PCR dataset for the period 2011-2023 demonstrate that our KP-PCR outperforms baselines by 2.3%-8.4% in the request necessity prediction and by 1.4%-6.9% in the tag recommendation.

Differentiating between a text written by a human and one generated by an LLM has become almost impossible. Information-hiding techniques such as digital watermarking or steganography can help by embedding information inside text in a form that is unlikely to be noticed. However, existing techniques, such as linguistic-based or format-based methods, change the semantics or cannot be applied to pure, unformatted text. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for information hiding called Innamark, which can conceal any byte-encoded sequence within a sufficiently long cover text. This method is implemented as a multi-platform library using the Kotlin programming language, which is accompanied by a command-line tool and a web interface. By substituting conventional whitespace characters with visually similar Unicode whitespace characters, our proposed scheme preserves the semantics of the cover text without changing the number of characters. Furthermore, we propose a specified structure for secret messages that enables configurable compression, encryption, hashing, and error correction. An experimental benchmark comparison on a dataset of 1 000 000 Wikipedia articles compares ten algorithms. The results demonstrate the robustness of our proposed Innamark method in various applications and the imperceptibility of its watermarks to humans. We discuss the limits to the embedding capacity and robustness of the algorithm and how these could be addressed in future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and published in the IEEE Access journal as extended version of doi:10.24251/HICSS.2025.886</p></details> |

They often allow attackers to achieve arbitrary code execution by redirecting a vulnerable program's control flow. While Control Flow Integrity (CFI) has gained traction to mitigate this exploitation path, developers are not provided with any direction on how to apply CFI to real-world software. In this work, we establish a taxonomy mapping LLVM's forward-edge CFI variants to memory corruption vulnerability classes, offering actionable guidance for developers seeking to deploy CFI incrementally in existing codebases. Based on the Top 10 Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) list, we identify four high-impact vulnerability categories and select one representative CVE for each. We evaluate LLVM's CFI against each CVE and explain why CFI blocks exploitation in two cases while failing in the other two, illustrating its potential and current limitations. Our findings support informed deployment decisions and provide a foundation for improving the practical use of CFI in production systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the need to perform comprehensive evaluations of automated program repair benchmarks: Sorald case study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15135v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In supporting the development of high-quality software, especially necessary in the era of LLMs, automated program repair (APR) tools aim to improve code quality by automatically addressing violations detected by static analysis profilers. Previous research tends to evaluate APR tools only for their ability to clear violations, neglecting their potential introduction of new (sometimes severe) violations, changes to code functionality and degrading of code structure. There is thus a need for research to develop and assess comprehensive evaluation frameworks for APR tools. This study addresses this research gap, and evaluates Sorald (a state-of-the-art APR tool) as a proof of concept. Sorald's effectiveness was evaluated in repairing 3,529 SonarQube violations across 30 rules within 2,393 Java code snippets extracted from Stack Overflow. Outcomes show that while Sorald fixes specific rule violations, it introduced 2,120 new faults (32 bugs, 2088 code smells), reduced code functional correctness--as evidenced by a 24% unit test failure rate--and degraded code structure, demonstrating the utility of our framework. Findings emphasize the need for evaluation methodologies that capture the full spectrum of APR tool effects, including side effects, to ensure their safe and effective adoption.</p></details> |  |
| **[Correctness-Guaranteed Code Generation via Constrained Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15866v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language Models (LMs) are increasingly being used for code generation, but ensuring the correctness of generated programs remains a significant challenge. Although imperfect code may be acceptable during software development with human oversight, domains such as video games and robotics require one-shot correctness for runtime-critical components. We present a constrained decoding algorithm for generating semantically correct programs that incorporates a context-sensitive parser, which, at each step, outputs a regular expression that satisfies a critical non-extensible property to guide the generation of the next token sequence that can continue to a correct program. To build such a context-sensitive parser, we propose a framework of a dynamic tree of parsers (ToP) during parsing, where each parser corresponds to a modular context-free grammar enriched with contextual information such as variable scopes and type constraints, with tree branches representing ambiguity in the future code segment. We demonstrate our approach through sLua, a strongly typed variant of Lua, showing that our method can generate semantically correct programs conforming to any prescribed scripting API. We further show that, with careful design, our semantic guarantees extend to runtime correctness, as validated in the application of generating game mechanics for a roguelike video game.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at COLM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Trace-Based Reconstruction of Quantum Circuit Dataflow in Surface Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14533v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Practical applications of quantum computing depend on fault-tolerant devices that employ error correction. A promising quantum error-correcting code for large-scale quantum computing is the surface code. For this code, Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing (FTQC) can be performed via lattice surgery, i.e. merging and splitting of encoded qubit patches on a 2D grid. Lattice surgery operations result in space-time patterns of activity that are defined in this work as access traces. This work demonstrates that the access traces reveal when, where, and how logical qubits interact. Leveraging this formulation, this work further introduces TraceQ, a trace-based reconstruction framework that is able to reconstruct the quantum circuit dataflow just by observing the patch activity at each trace entry. The framework is supported by heuristics for handling inherent ambiguity in the traces, and demonstrates its effectiveness on a range of synthetic fault-tolerant quantum benchmarks. The access traces can have applications in a wide range of scenarios, enabling analysis and profiling of execution of quantum programs and the hardware they run on. As one example use of TraceQ, this work investigates whether such traces can act as a side channel through which an observer can recover the circuit's structure and identify known subroutines in a larger program or even whole programs. The findings show that indeed the minimal access traces can be used to recover subroutines or even whole quantum programs with very high accuracy. Only a single trace per program execution is needed and the processing can be done fully offline. Along with the custom heuristics, advanced subgraph matching algorithms used in this work enable a high rate of locating the subroutines while executing in minimal time.</p></details> |  |

Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated their potential for enhancing the degree of automation in formal verification by, e.g., generating formal specifications as essential to deductive verification, yet exhibit poor scalability due to context-length limitations and, more importantly, the difficulty of inferring complex, interprocedural specifications. This paper outlines Preguss - a modular, fine-grained framework for automating the generation and refinement of formal specifications. Preguss synergizes between static analysis and deductive verification by orchestrating two components: (i) potential runtime error (RTE)-guided construction and prioritization of verification units, and (ii) LLM-aided synthesis of interprocedural specifications at the unit level. We envisage that Preguss paves a compelling path towards the automated verification of large-scale programs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Posit...</summary><p>Position paper to appear in the 1st International Workshop on Language Models and Programming Languages (LMPL '25)</p></details> |

The standard way that PBT users generate test inputs is via generators that describe how to sample test inputs through random choices. To achieve a good distribution over test inputs, users must tune their generators, i.e., decide on the weights of these individual random choices. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to understand how to choose individual generator weights in order to achieve a desired distribution, so today this process is tedious and limits the distributions that can be practically achieved. In this paper, we develop techniques for the automatic and offline tuning of generators. Given a generator with undetermined symbolic weights and an objective function, our approach automatically learns values for these weights that optimize for the objective. We describe useful objective functions that allow users to (1) target desired distributions and (2) improve the diversity and validity of their test cases. We have implemented our approach in a novel discrete probabilistic programming system, Loaded Dice, that supports differentiation and parameter learning, and use it as a language for generators. We empirically demonstrate that our approach is effective at optimizing generator distributions according to the specified objective functions. We also perform a thorough evaluation on PBT benchmarks, demonstrating that, when automatically tuned for diversity and validity, the generators exhibit a 3.1-7.4x speedup in bug finding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of OOPSLA '25 paper</p></details> |

We extend prior "structural-entropy concepts" to the program domain by pairing entropy with abstract syntax tree (AST) analysis. For any fixed prompt, we collect the multiset of depth-bounded subtrees of AST in each generated program and treat their relative frequencies as a probability distribution. We then measure stability in two complementary ways: (i) Jensen-Shannon divergence, a symmetric, bounded indicator of structural overlap, and (ii) a Structural Cross-Entropy ratio that highlights missing high-probability patterns. Both metrics admit structural-only and token-aware variants, enabling separate views on control-flow shape and identifier-level variability. Unlike pass@k, BLEU, or CodeBLEU, our metrics are reference-free, language-agnostic, and execution-independent. We benchmark several leading LLMs on standard code generation tasks, demonstrating that AST-driven structural entropy reveals nuances in model consistency and robustness. The method runs in O(n,d) time with no external tests, providing a lightweight addition to the code-generation evaluation toolkit.</p></details> | ASE-NIER |

In particular, fundamental knowledge of UML modeling and practice in creating high-quality UML diagrams are included in SE-relevant courses in the undergraduate programs of many universities. This leads to a time-consuming and labor-intensive task for educators to review and grade a large number of UML diagrams created by the students. Recent advancements in generative AI techniques, such as ChatGPT, have paved new ways to automate many SE tasks. However, current research or tools seldom explore the capabilities of ChatGPT in evaluating the quality of UML diagrams. This paper aims to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of ChatGPT in assessing the quality of UML use case diagrams, class diagrams, and sequence diagrams. First, 11 evaluation criteria with grading details were proposed for these UML diagrams. Next, a series of experiments were designed and conducted on 40 students' UML modeling reports to explore the performance of ChatGPT in evaluating and grading these UML diagrams. The research findings reveal that ChatGPT can complete this assessment task, but it cannot substitute for human experts yet. Meanwhile, there are five evaluation discrepancies between ChatGPT and human experts. These discrepancies vary in the use of different evaluation criteria in different types of UML diagrams, presenting ChatGPT's strength and weakness in this automatic evaluation task.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 6 images, 8 tables, Manuscript revision submitted to a journal (2025)</p></details> |
| **[Tight Inter-Core Cache Contention Analysis for WCET Estimation on Multicore Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13863v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>WCET (Worst-Case Execution Time) estimation on multicore architecture is particularly challenging mainly due to the complex accesses over cache shared by multiple cores. Existing analysis identifies possible contentions between parallel tasks by leveraging the partial order of the tasks or their program regions. Unfortunately, they overestimate the number of cache misses caused by a remote block access without considering the actual cache state and the number of accesses. This paper reports a new analysis for inter-core cache contention. Based on the order of program regions in a task, we first identify memory references that could be affected if a remote access occurs in a region. Afterwards, a fine-grained contention analysis is constructed that computes the number of cache misses based on the access quantity of local and remote blocks. We demonstrate that the overall inter-core cache interference of a task can be obtained via dynamic programming. Experiments show that compared to existing methods, the proposed analysis reduces inter-core cache interference and WCET estimations by 52.31% and 8.94% on average, without significantly increasing computation overhead.</p></details> |  |

We introduce COMPASS (COdility's Multi-dimensional Programming ASSessment), a comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses code generation across three dimensions: correctness, efficiency, and quality. COMPASS consists of 50 competitive programming problems from real Codility competitions, providing authentic human baselines from 393,150 submissions. Unlike existing benchmarks that treat algorithmically inefficient solutions identically to optimal ones provided they pass test cases, COMPASS systematically evaluates runtime efficiency and code quality using industry-standard analysis tools. Our evaluation of three leading reasoning-enhanced models, Anthropic Claude Opus 4, Google Gemini 2.5 Pro, and OpenAI O4-Mini-High, reveals that models achieving high correctness scores do not necessarily produce efficient algorithms or maintainable code. These findings highlight the importance of evaluating more than just correctness to truly understand the real-world capabilities of code generation models. COMPASS serves as a guiding framework, charting a path for future research toward AI systems that are robust, reliable, and ready for production use.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tensor Program Optimization for the RISC-V Vector Extension Using Probabilistic Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01457v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RISC-V provides a flexible and scalable platform for applications ranging from embedded devices to high-performance computing clusters. Particularly, its RISC-V Vector Extension (RVV) becomes of interest for the acceleration of AI workloads. But writing software that efficiently utilizes the vector units of RISC-V CPUs without expert knowledge requires the programmer to rely on the autovectorization features of compilers or hand-crafted libraries like muRISCV-NN. Smarter approaches, like autotuning frameworks, have been missing the integration with the RISC-V RVV extension, thus heavily limiting the efficient deployment of complex AI workloads. In this paper, we present a workflow based on the TVM compiler to efficiently map AI workloads onto RISC-V vector units. Instead of relying on hand-crafted libraries, we integrated the RVV extension into TVM's MetaSchedule framework, a probabilistic program framework for tensor operation tuning. We implemented different RISC-V SoCs on an FPGA and tuned a wide range of AI workloads on them. We found that our proposal shows a mean improvement of 46% in execution latency when compared against the autovectorization feature of GCC, and 29% against muRISCV-NN. Moreover, the binary resulting from our proposal has a smaller code memory footprint, making it more suitable for embedded devices. Finally, we also evaluated our solution on a commercially available RISC-V SoC implementing the RVV 1.0 Vector Extension and found our solution is able to find mappings that are 35% faster on average than the ones proposed by LLVM. We open-sourced our proposal for the community to expand it to target other RISC-V extensions.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 10 figures, 2 algorithms</p></details> |

However, these visual aids do not seem to be beneficial for large language models (LLMs) in the same way since the code is processed as a linear sequence of tokens. Furthermore, these additional tokens can lead to increased computational costs and longer response times for LLMs. If such formatting elements are non-essential to LLMs, we can reduce such costs by removing them from the code. To figure out the role played by formatting elements, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study to evaluate the impact of code formatting on LLM performance and efficiency. Through large-scale experiments on Fill-in-the-Middle Code Completion tasks across four programming languages (Java, Python, C++, C\#) and ten LLMs-including both commercial and open-source models-we systematically analyze token count and performance when formatting elements are removed. Key findings indicate that LLMs can maintain performance across formatted code and unformatted code, achieving an average input token reduction of 24.5\% with negligible output token reductions. This makes code format removal a practical optimization strategy for improving LLM efficiency. Further exploration reveals that both prompting and fine-tuning LLMs can lead to significant reductions (up to 36.1\%) in output code length without compromising correctness. To facilitate practical applications, we develop a bidirectional code transformation tool for format processing, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing LLM inference workflows, ensuring both human readability and LLM efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICSE'26 (First Cycle)</p></details> |

Unlocking the Power of Feedback-Driven Deep Learning Framework Fuzzing via LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17642v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Learning (DL) frameworks have served as fundamental components in DL systems over the last decade. However, bugs in DL frameworks could lead to catastrophic consequences in critical scenarios. A simple yet effective way to find bugs in DL frameworks is fuzz testing (Fuzzing). Existing approaches focus on test generation, leaving execution results with high semantic value (e.g., coverage information, bug reports, and exception logs) in the wild, which can serve as multiple types of feedback. To fill this gap, we propose FUEL to effectively utilize the feedback information, which comprises two Large Language Models (LLMs): analysis LLM and generation LLM. Specifically, analysis LLM infers analysis summaries from feedback information, while the generation LLM creates tests guided by these summaries. Furthermore, based on multiple feedback guidance, we design two additional components: (i) a feedback-aware simulated annealing algorithm to select operators for test generation, enriching test diversity. (ii) a program self-repair strategy to automatically repair invalid tests, enhancing test validity. We evaluate FUEL on the two most popular DL frameworks, and experiment results show that FUEL can improve line code coverage of PyTorch and TensorFlow by 9.15% and 14.70% over state-of-the-art baselines (e.g., TitanFuzz and WhiteFox). By the time of submission, FUEL has detected 104 previously unknown bugs for PyTorch and TensorFlow, with 93 confirmed as new bugs, 49 already fixed, and 5 assigned CVE IDs.

| **[Reactive Semantics for User Interface Description Languages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13610v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>User Interface Description Languages (UIDLs) are high-level languages that facilitate the development of Human-Machine Interfaces, such as Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications. They usually provide first-class primitives to specify how the program reacts to an external event (user input, network message), and how data flows through the program. Although these domain-specific languages are now widely used to implement safety-critical GUIs, little work has been invested in their formalization and verification. In this paper, we propose a denotational semantic model for a core reactive UIDL, Smalite, which we argue is expressive enough to encode constructs from more realistic languages. This preliminary work may be used as a stepping stone to produce a formally verified compiler for UIDLs.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings ICE 2025, arXiv:2508.12308</p></details> |

Verifying the correctness of code generated by LLMs is key to improving their usefulness, but there have been no comprehensive and fully autonomous solutions developed yet. Hallucinations are a major concern when LLMs are applied blindly to problems without taking the time and effort to verify their outputs, and an inability to explain the logical reasoning of LLMs leads to issues with trusting their results. To address these challenges while also aiming to effectively apply LLMs, this paper proposes a dual-LLM system (i.e. a generative LLM and a discriminative LLM) and experiments with the usage of LLMs for the generation of a large volume of compiler tests. We experimented with a number of LLMs possessing varying parameter counts and presented results using ten carefully-chosen metrics that we describe in detail in our narrative. Through our findings, it is evident that LLMs possess the promising potential to generate quality compiler tests and verify them automatically.</p></details> |  |

In prior work, we applied a cognitive systems engineering approach to identify an initial set of affordances and implemented a VR environment to support RE through spatial persistence and interactivity. In this work, we extend that platform with an integrated large language model (LLM) agent capable of querying binary analysis tools, answering technical questions, and dynamically generating immersive 3D visualizations in alignment with analyst tasks. We describe the system architecture and our evaluation process and results. Our pilot study shows that while LLMs can generate meaningful 3D call graphs (for small programs) that align with design principles, output quality varies widely. This work raises open questions about the potential for LLMs to function as visualization agents, constructing 3D representations that reflect cognitive design principles without explicit training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE VISSOFT 2025</p></details> |

SWE-Bench is a recent benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based repair systems using real issues and pull requests mined from 12 popular open-source Python repositories. Its public leaderboards -- SWE-Bench Lite and SWE-Bench Verified -- have become central platforms for tracking progress and comparing solutions. However, because the submission process does not require detailed documentation, the architectural design and origin of many solutions remain unclear. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of all submissions to the SWE-Bench Lite (79 entries) and Verified (99 entries) leaderboards, analyzing 80 unique approaches across dimensions such as submitter type, product availability, LLM usage, and system architecture. Our findings reveal the dominance of proprietary LLMs (especially Claude 3.5), the presence of both agentic and non-agentic designs, and a contributor base spanning from individual developers to large tech companies.</p></details> |  |

However, studies reveal that their grasp of fundamental programming concepts, such as data flow and control flow, remains shallow, leading to fragile performance when code requires deeper reasoning. This limitation restricts the practical adoption of LLMs in real-world software development. To address this issue, this work introduces a counterfactual code augmentation framework combined with concept-aware tuning, designed to guide LLMs toward stronger conceptual understanding. Comprehensive evaluation across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Hierarchical Knowledge Injection for Improving LLM-based Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24015v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompting LLMs with bug-related context (e.g., error messages, stack traces) improves automated program repair, but many bugs still remain unresolved. In real-world projects, developers often rely on broader repository and project-level context beyond the local code to resolve such bugs. In this paper, we investigate how automatically extracting and providing such knowledge can improve LLM-based program repair. We propose a layered knowledge injection framework that incrementally augments LLMs with structured context. It starts with the Bug Knowledge Layer, which includes information such as the buggy function and failing tests; expands to the Repository Knowledge Layer, which adds structural dependencies, related files, and commit history; and finally injects the Project Knowledge Layer, which incorporates relevant details from documentation and previously fixed bugs. We evaluate this framework on a dataset of 314 bugs from BugsInPy using two LLMs (Llama 3.3 and GPT-4o-mini), and analyze fix rates across six bug types. By progressively injecting knowledge across layers, our approach achieves a fix rate of 79% (250/314) using Llama 3.3, a significant improvement of 23% over previous work. All bug types show improvement with the addition of repository-level context, while only a subset benefit further from project-level knowledge, highlighting that different bug types require different levels of contextual information for effective repair. We also analyze the remaining unresolved bugs and find that more complex and structurally isolated bugs, such as Program Anomaly and GUI bugs, remain difficult even after injecting all available information. Our results show that layered context injection improves program repair and suggest the need for interactive and adaptive APR systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE/ACM Automated Software Engineering (ASE) 2025 Conference</p></details> |

However, these models require significant computational resources for training and fine-tuning, posing challenges for real-world adoption in resource-constrained environments. To address this, the research community has increasingly turned to Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)-a class of techniques that enables the adaptation of large models by updating only a small subset of parameters, rather than the entire model. In this Systematic Literature Review (SLR), we examine the growing application of PEFT techniques-across a wide range of software engineering tasks. We analyze how these methods are used to optimize various deep learning (DL) architectures, focusing on their impact on both performance and efficiency. Our study synthesizes findings from 28 peer-reviewed papers, identifying patterns in configuration strategies and adaptation trade-offs. The outcome of this review is a comprehensive taxonomy that categorizes PEFT usage by task type, distinguishing between generative (e.g., Code Summarization) and non-generative (e.g., Code Clone Detection) scenarios. Our findings aim to inform future research and guide the practical deployment of PEFT in sustainable, AI-powered software development.

Unlike conventional code generation tools, agentic systems are capable of decomposing high-level goals, coordinating multi-step processes, and adapting their behavior based on intermediate feedback. These capabilities are transforming the software development practice. As this emerging field evolves rapidly, there is a need to define its scope, consolidate its technical foundations, and identify open research challenges. This survey provides a comprehensive and timely review of AI agentic programming. We introduce a taxonomy of agent behaviors and system architectures, and examine core techniques including planning, memory and context management, tool integration, and execution monitoring. We also analyze existing benchmarks and evaluation methodologies used to assess coding agent performance. Our study identifies several key challenges, including limitations in handling long context, a lack of persistent memory across tasks, and concerns around safety, alignment with user intent, and collaboration with human developers. We discuss emerging opportunities to improve the reliability, adaptability, and transparency of agentic systems. By synthesizing recent advances and outlining future directions, this survey aims to provide a foundation for research and development in building the next generation of intelligent and trustworthy AI coding agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion is a code repair operator and generator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11110v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code diffusion models generate code by iteratively removing noise from the latent representation of a code snippet. During later steps of the diffusion process, when the code snippet has almost converged, differences between discrete representations of these snippets look like last-mile repairs applied to broken or incomplete code. We evaluate the extent to which this resemblance can be exploited to leverage pre-trained code diffusion models for the problem of last-mile repair by considering two applications with significant potential. First, we can leverage the diffusion model for last-mile repair by adding noise to a broken code snippet and resuming the diffusion process. Second, we can leverage the diffusion model to generate arbitrary amount of training data for last-mile repair tasks (that are computationally more efficient) by sampling an intermediate program (input) and the final program (output) from the diffusion process. We perform experiments on 3 domains (Python, Excel and PowerShell) to evaluate applications, as well as analyze properties.</p></details> | 12 pages |

Beyond the sheer number of subsystems involved, the difficulty stems from their diversity and interaction depth. In this paper, we use a compact heterogeneous robotic system (HeROS), combining mobile and manipulation capabilities, as a demonstration vehicle under dynamically changing tasks. Notably, all its subsystems are powered by ROS. The use of compatible interfaces and other ROS integration capabilities simplifies the construction of such systems. However, this only addresses part of the complexity: the semantic coherence and structural traceability are even more important for precise coordination and call for deliberate engineering methods. The Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) discipline, which emerged from the experience of complexity management in large-scale engineering domains, offers the methodological foundations needed. Despite their strengths in complementary aspects of robotics systems engineering, the lack of a unified approach to integrate ROS and MBSE hinders the full potential of these tools. Motivated by the anticipated impact of such a synergy in robotics practice, we propose a structured methodology based on MeROS - a SysML metamodel created specifically to put the ROS-based systems into the focus of the MBSE workflow. As its methodological backbone, we adapt the well-known V-model to this context, illustrating how complex robotic systems can be designed with traceability and validation capabilities embedded into their lifecycle using practices familiar to engineering teams.</p></details> | 22 pages |

GPS treats the task of model checking a program as a directed search of the program states, guided by a compositional, summary-based static analysis. The summaries produced by static analysis are used both to prune away infeasible paths and to drive test generation to reach new, unexplored program states. GPS can find both proofs of safety and counter-examples to safety (i.e., inputs that trigger bugs), and features a novel two-layered search strategy that renders it particularly efficient at finding bugs in programs featuring long, input-dependent error paths. To make GPS refutationally complete (in the sense that it will find an error if one exists, if it is allotted enough time), we introduce an instrumentation technique and show that it helps GPS achieve refutation-completeness without sacrificing overall performance. We benchmarked GPS on a suite of benchmarks including both programs from the Software Verification Competition (SV-COMP) and from prior literature, and found that our implementation of GPS outperforms state-of-the-art software model checkers (including the top performers in SV-COMP ReachSafety-Loops category), both in terms of the number of benchmarks solved and in terms of running time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of paper in OOPSLA 2025 (with updated evaluations section compared to v1 manuscript). 37 pages</p></details> |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in mitigating this effort, existing LLM-based automated debugging methods underperform on industrial-scale modules. A major reason for this is bug signal dilution in long contexts, where a few bug-relevant tokens are overwhelmed by hundreds of unrelated lines, diffusing the model's attention. To address this issue, we introduce ARSP, a two-stage system that mitigates dilution via semantics-guided fragmentation. A Partition LLM splits a module into semantically tight fragments; a Repair LLM patches each fragment; edits are merged without altering unrelated logic. A synthetic data framework generates fragment-level training pairs spanning bug types, design styles, and scales to supervise both models. Experiments show that ARSP achieves 77.92% pass@1 and 83.88% pass@5, outperforming mainstream commercial LLMs including Claude-3.7 and SOTA automated Verilog debugging tools Strider and MEIC. Also, semantic partitioning improves pass@1 by 11.6% and pass@5 by 10.2% over whole-module debugging, validating the effectiveness of fragment-level scope reduction in LLM-based Verilog debugging.</p></details> |  |

By decomposing a system into simpler, interacting agents, agent-based modeling (ABM) allows researchers to observe the emergence of complex phenomena. High-performance array computing libraries like JAX can help scale such computational models to a large number of agents by using automatic vectorization and just-in-time (JIT) compilation. One of the caveats of using JAX to achieve such scaling is that the shapes of arrays used in the computational model should remain immutable throughout the simulation. In the context of agent-based modeling (ABM), this can pose constraints on certain agent manipulation operations that require flexible data structures. A subset of which is represented by the ability to update a dynamically selected number of agents by applying distinct changes to them during a simulation. To this effect, we introduce Abmax, an ABM framework based on JAX that implements multiple just-in-time (JIT) compilable algorithms to provide this functionality. On the canonical predation model benchmark, Abmax achieves runtime performance comparable to state-of-the-art implementations. Further, we show that this functionality can also be vectorized, making it possible to run many similar agent-based models in parallel. We also present two examples in the form of a traffic-flow model and a financial market model to show the use case of Abmax.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables, 2 algorithms</p></details> |

Empirical Evidence of Quantized Small Language Models for Automated Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16499v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved the accuracy of automated program repair (APR) methods. However, LLMs are constrained by high computational resource requirements. Aims: We focus on small language models (SLMs), which perform well even with limited computational resources compared to LLMs. We aim to evaluate whether SLMs can achieve competitive performance in APR tasks. Method: We conducted experiments on the QuixBugs benchmark to compare the bug-fixing accuracy of SLMs and LLMs. We also analyzed the impact of int8 quantization on APR performance. Results: The latest SLMs can fix bugs as accurately as--or even more accurately than--LLMs. Also, int8 quantization had minimal effect on APR accuracy while significantly reducing memory requirements. Conclusions: SLMs present a viable alternative to LLMs for APR, offering competitive accuracy with lower computational costs, and quantization can further enhance their efficiency without compromising effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

Still in its infancy, large language model (LLM)-based proof generation lags behind LLM-based code generation. In this paper, we present AutoVerus. AutoVerus uses LLMs to automatically generate correctness proof for Rust code. AutoVerus is designed to match the unique features of Verus, a verification tool that can prove the correctness of Rust code using proofs and specifications also written in Rust. AutoVerus consists of a network of LLM agents that are crafted and orchestrated to mimic human experts' three phases of proof construction: preliminary proof generation, proof refinement guided by generic tips, and proof debugging guided by verification errors. To thoroughly evaluate AutoVerus and help foster future research in this direction, we have built a benchmark suite of 150 non-trivial proof tasks, based on existing code-generation benchmarks and verification benchmarks. Our evaluation shows that AutoVerus can automatically generate correct proof for more than 90% of them, with more than half of them tackled in less than 30 seconds or 3 LLM calls.</p></details> | OOPSLA 2025 |
| **[Using LLMs and Essence to Support Software Practice Adoption](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16445v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP) have enabled the development of automated tools that support various domains, including software engineering. However, while NLP and artificial intelligence (AI) research has extensively focused on tasks such as code generation, less attention has been given to automating support for the adoption of best practices, the evolution of ways of working, and the monitoring of process health. This study addresses this gap by exploring the integration of Essence, a standard and thinking framework for managing software engineering practices, with large language models (LLMs). To this end, a specialised chatbot was developed to assist students and professionals in understanding and applying Essence. The chatbot employs a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system to retrieve relevant contextual information from a curated knowledge base. Four different LLMs were used to create multiple chatbot configurations, each evaluated both as a base model and augmented with the RAG system. The system performance was evaluated through both the relevance of retrieved context and the quality of generated responses. Comparative analysis against the general-purpose LLMs demonstrated that the proposed system consistently outperforms its baseline counterpart in domain-specific tasks. By facilitating access to structured software engineering knowledge, this work contributes to bridging the gap between theoretical frameworks and practical application, potentially improving process management and the adoption of software development practices. While further validation through user studies is required, these findings highlight the potential of LLM-based automation to enhance learning and decision-making in software engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Classification or Prompting: A Case Study on Legal Requirements Traceability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04916v4)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>New regulations are introduced to ensure software development aligns with ethical concerns and protects public safety. Showing compliance requires tracing requirements to legal provisions. Requirements traceability is a key task where engineers must analyze technical requirements against target artifacts, often within limited time. Manually analyzing complex systems with hundreds of requirements is infeasible. The legal dimension adds challenges that increase effort. In this paper, we investigate two automated solutions based on language models, including large ones (LLMs). The first solution, Kashif, is a classifier that leverages sentence transformers and semantic similarity. The second solution, RICE_LRT, prompts a recent generative LLM based on RICE, a prompt engineering framework. On a benchmark dataset, we empirically evaluate Kashif and compare it against five different baseline classifiers from the literature. Kashif can identify trace links with a recall of 67%, precision of 50%, and F2 score of 63%, outperforming the best baseline by a substantial margin of 41 percentage points (pp) in F2. However, on unseen, more complex requirements documents traced to the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Kashif performs poorly, yielding an average recall of 15%, an average precision of 10%, and an average F2 score of 13.5%. On the same documents, however, our RICE solution yields an average recall of 84%, an average precision of 30%, and an average F2 score of 61%. RICE achieved a remarkable improvement of 47.5 pp over Kashif in terms of F2 score. Our results suggest that requirements traceability in the legal context cannot be simply addressed by building classifiers, as such solutions do not generalize and fail to perform well on complex regulations and requirements. Resorting to generative LLMs, with careful prompt engineering, is thus a more promising alternative.</p></details> | 38 pages, 4 figues |

Yet, their real-world effectiveness in detecting diverse software bugs, particularly complex, security-relevant vulnerabilities, remains underexplored. This study presents a systematic, empirical evaluation of these three leading LLMs using a benchmark of foundational programming errors, classic security flaws, and advanced, production-grade bugs in C++ and Python. The dataset integrates real code from SEED Labs, OpenSSL (via the Suresoft GLaDOS database), and PyBugHive, validated through local compilation and testing pipelines. A novel multi-stage, context-aware prompting protocol simulates realistic debugging scenarios, while a graded rubric measures detection accuracy, reasoning depth, and remediation quality. Our results show that all models excel at identifying syntactic and semantic issues in well-scoped code, making them promising for educational use and as first-pass reviewers in automated code auditing. Performance diminishes in scenarios involving complex security vulnerabilities and large-scale production code, with ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3 generally providing more nuanced contextual analyses than LLaMA 4. This highlights both the promise and the present constraints of LLMs in serving as reliable code analysis tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[AetherCode: Evaluating LLMs' Ability to Win In Premier Programming Competitions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16402v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Competitive programming has emerged as a critical benchmark for evaluating the reasoning and coding capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite impressive progress on existing benchmarks, we argue that current evaluations overstate model proficiency, masking a substantial gap between LLMs and elite human programmers. This gap arises from two key limitations: insufficient difficulty and scope of benchmark problems, and evaluation bias from low-quality test cases. To address these shortcomings, we present AetherCode, a new benchmark that draws problems from premier programming competitions such as IOI and ICPC, offering broader coverage and higher difficulty. AetherCode further incorporates comprehensive, expert-validated test suites built through a hybrid of automated generation and human curation, ensuring rigorous and reliable assessment. By combining challenging problem design with robust evaluation, AetherCode provides a more faithful measure of LLM capabilities and sets a new standard for future research in code reasoning.</p></details> | 15 pages |

We consider Mealy machines that have stochastic delays associated with each transition and explore how the learner can efficiently arrive at faithful estimates of those machines, the precision of which crucially relies on repetitive sampling of transition delays. While it is possible to na\"ively integrate the delay sampling into AAL algorithms such as $L^*$, this leads to considerable oversampling near the root of the state space. We address this problem by separating conceptually the learning of behavior and delays such that the learner uses the information gained while learning the logical behavior to arrive at efficient input sequences for collecting the needed delay samples. We put emphasis on treating cases in which identical input/output behaviors might stem from distinct delay characteristics. Finally, we provide empirical evidence that our method outperforms the na\"ive baseline across a wide range of benchmarks and investigate its applicability in a realistic setting by studying the join order in a relational database.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Integrated Formal Methods (iFM) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Applications and Challenges of Fairness APIs in Machine Learning Software](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16377v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine Learning software systems are frequently used in our day-to-day lives. Some of these systems are used in various sensitive environments to make life-changing decisions. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that these AI/ML systems do not make any discriminatory decisions for any specific groups or populations. In that vein, different bias detection and mitigation open-source software libraries (aka API libraries) are being developed and used. In this paper, we conduct a qualitative study to understand in what scenarios these open-source fairness APIs are used in the wild, how they are used, and what challenges the developers of these APIs face while developing and adopting these libraries. We have analyzed 204 GitHub repositories (from a list of 1885 candidate repositories) which used 13 APIs that are developed to address bias in ML software. We found that these APIs are used for two primary purposes (i.e., learning and solving real-world problems), targeting 17 unique use-cases. Our study suggests that developers are not well-versed in bias detection and mitigation; they face lots of troubleshooting issues, and frequently ask for opinions and resources. Our findings can be instrumental for future bias-related software engineering research, and for guiding educators in developing more state-of-the-art curricula.</p></details> |  |

This makes tool selection and architectural design decisions a complex problem, especially for large-scale software systems. To tackle this issue, we introduce CAPI, the Comprehensive Architecture Pattern Integration method that uses a diagnostic decision tree to suggest architectural patterns depending on user needs. By suggesting patterns instead of tools, the overall complexity for further decisions is lower as there are fewer architectural patterns than tools due to the abstract nature of patterns. Moreover, since tools implement patterns, each non-proposed pattern reduces the number of tools to choose from, reducing complexity. We iteratively developed CAPI, evaluating its understandability and usability in small studies with academic participants. When satisfied with the outcome, we performed a user-study with industry representatives to investigate the state-of-the-art in technology selection and the effectiveness of our proposed method. We find that technology selection is largely performed via trial and error, that CAPI is uniformly perceived as helpful, and that CAPI is able to reproduce the productive architectural environments of our participants.</p></details> |  |

Despite the popularity of MSA in the software industry, there is a limited evidence-based and thorough understanding of the types of issues (e.g., errors, faults, failures, and bugs) that microservices system developers experience, the causes of the issues, and the solutions as potential fixing strategies to address the issues. To ameliorate this gap, we conducted a mixed-methods empirical study that collected data from 2,641 issues from the issue tracking systems of 15 open-source microservices systems on GitHub, 15 interviews, and an online survey completed by 150 practitioners from 42 countries across 6 continents. Our analysis led to comprehensive taxonomies for the issues, causes, and solutions. The findings of this study informthat Technical Debt, Continuous Integration and Delivery, Exception Handling, Service Execution and Communication, and Security are the most dominant issues in microservices systems. Furthermore, General Programming Errors, Missing Features and Artifacts, and Invalid Configuration and Communication are the main causes behind the issues. Finally, we found 177 types of solutions that can be applied to fix the identified issues. Based on our study results, we formulated future research directions that could help researchers and practitioners to engineer emergent and next-generation microservices systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 5 images, 7 tables, Manuscript submitted to a Journal (2025)</p></details> |
| **[Mutation-Guided Unit Test Generation with a Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02954v4)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unit tests play a vital role in uncovering potential faults in software. While tools like EvoSuite focus on maximizing code coverage, recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shifted attention toward LLM-based test generation. However, code coverage metrics -- such as line and branch coverage -- remain overly emphasized in reported research, despite being weak indicators of a test suite's fault-detection capability. In contrast, mutation score offers a more reliable and stringent measure, as demonstrated in our findings where some test suites achieve 100% coverage but only 4% mutation score. Although a few studies consider mutation score, the effectiveness of LLMs in killing mutants remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose MUTGEN, a mutation-guided, LLM-based test generation approach that incorporates mutation feedback directly into the prompt. Evaluated on 204 subjects from two benchmarks, MUTGEN significantly outperforms both EvoSuite and vanilla prompt-based strategies in terms of mutation score. Furthermore, MUTGEN introduces an iterative generation mechanism that pushes the limits of LLMs in killing additional mutants. Our study also provide insights into the limitations of LLM-based generation, analyzing the reasons for live and uncovered mutants, and the impact of different mutation operators on generation effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

However, despite their strengths in test data generation, these tools are constrained by the types of test oracles they support, often limited to crashes, regressions, and noncompliance with API specifications or design standards. This paper introduces SATORI (Static API Test ORacle Inference), a black-box approach for generating test oracles for REST APIs by analyzing their OpenAPI Specification. SATORI uses large language models to infer the expected behavior of an API by analyzing the properties of the response fields of its operations, such as their name and descriptions. To foster its adoption, we extended the PostmanAssertify tool to automatically convert the test oracles reported by SATORI into executable assertions. Evaluation results on 17 operations from 12 industrial APIs show that SATORI can automatically generate up to hundreds of valid test oracles per operation. SATORI achieved an F1-score of 74.3%, outperforming the state-of-the-art dynamic approach AGORA+ (69.3%)-which requires executing the API-when generating comparable oracle types. Moreover, our findings show that static and dynamic oracle inference methods are complementary: together, SATORI and AGORA+ found 90% of the oracles in our annotated ground-truth dataset. Notably, SATORI uncovered 18 bugs in popular APIs (Amadeus Hotel, Deutschebahn, FDIC, GitLab, Marvel, OMDb and Vimeo) leading to documentation updates by the API maintainers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, ASE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Metamorphic Coverage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16307v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metamorphic testing is a widely used methodology that examines an expected relation between pairs of executions to automatically find bugs, such as correctness bugs. We found that code coverage cannot accurately measure the extent to which code is validated and mutation testing is computationally expensive for evaluating metamorphic testing methods. In this work, we propose Metamorphic Coverage (MC), a coverage metric that examines the distinct code executed by pairs of test inputs within metamorphic testing. Our intuition is that, typically, a bug can be observed if the corresponding code is executed when executing either test input but not the other one, so covering more differential code covered by pairs of test inputs might be more likely to expose bugs. While most metamorphic testing methods have been based on this general intuition, our work defines and systematically evaluates MC on five widely used metamorphic testing methods for testing database engines, compilers, and constraint solvers. The code measured by MC overlaps with the bug-fix locations of 50 of 64 bugs found by metamorphic testing methods, and MC has a stronger positive correlation with bug numbers than line coverage. MC is 4x more sensitive than line coverage in distinguishing testing methods' effectiveness, and the average value of MC is 6x smaller than line coverage while still capturing the part of the program that is being tested. MC required 359x less time than mutation testing. Based on a case study for an automated database system testing approach, we demonstrate that when used for feedback guidance, MC significantly outperforms code coverage, by finding 41\% more bugs. Consequently, this work might have broad applications for assessing metamorphic testing methods and improving test-case generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Systematic Mapping Study on Smart Cities Modeling Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16273v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Smart City concept was introduced to define an idealized city characterized by automation and connection. It then evolved rapidly by including further aspects, such as economy, environment. Since then, many publications have explored various aspects of Smart Cities across different application domains and research communities, acknowledging the interdisciplinary nature of this subject. In particular, our interest focuses on how smart cities are designed and modeled, as a whole or as regards with their subsystems, when dealing with the accomplishment of the research goals in this complex and heterogeneous domain. To this aim, we performed a systematic mapping study on smart cities modeling approaches identifying the relevant contributions (i) to get an overview of existing research approaches, (ii) to identify whether there are any publication trends, and (iii) to identify possible future research directions. We followed the guidelines for conducting systematic mapping studies by Petersen et al. to analyze smart cities modeling publications. Our analysis revealed the following main findings: (i) smart governance is the most investigated and modeled smart city dimension; (ii) the most used modeling approaches are business, architectural, and ontological modeling approaches, spanning multiple application fields; (iii) the great majority of existing technologies for modeling smart cities are not yet proven in operational environments; (iv) diverse research communities publish their results in a multitude of different venues which further motivates the presented literature study. Researchers can use our results for better understanding the state-of-the-art in modeling smart cities, and as a foundation for further analysis of specific approaches about smart cities modeling. Lastly, we also discuss the impact of our analysis for the Model-Driven Engineering community.</p></details> |  |

These techniques typically require a normative process model as input, specifically designed for the processes to be analyzed. Such models are rarely available, though, and their creation involves considerable manual effort.However, reference process models serve as best-practice templates for organizational processes in a plethora of domains, containing valuable knowledge about general behavioral relations in well-engineered processes. These general models can thus mitigate the need for dedicated models by providing a basis to check for undesired behavior. Still, finding a perfectly matching reference model for a real-life event log is unrealistic because organizational needs can vary, despite similarities in process execution. Furthermore, event logs may encompass behavior related to different reference models, making traditional conformance checking impractical as it requires aligning process executions to individual models. To still use reference models for conformance checking, we propose a framework for mining declarative best-practice constraints from a reference model collection, automatically selecting constraints that are relevant for a given event log, and checking for best-practice violations. We demonstrate the capability of our framework to detect best-practice violations through an evaluation based on real-world process model collections and event logs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to Information Systems</p></details> |

This challenge is amplified when targeting newer or less-documented GPU architectures where traditional development aids are scarce. This paper introduces an LLM-powered "GPU Kernel Scientist," an automated methodology for iteratively refining accelerator kernels. Our methodology employs LLMs in a multi-stage, evolutionary process: (a) strategically selecting promising prior code versions as a basis for new iterations; (b) generating hypotheses for optimization experiments, based on existing code and assimilated knowledge from general GPU literature; and (c) autonomously implementing these experiments through code modification and subsequent submission to an external evaluation system, using only observed timing data as performance feedback. We detail how this approach navigates the challenges of the AMD MI300 target architecture and leverages LLMs to compensate for limited domain-specific human expertise. In addition to our results, we present the architectural design, operational workflow, and qualitative insights, highlighting the potential of LLM-driven agents to democratise and accelerate GPU kernel optimization, especially in resource-constrained or rapidly updating hardware environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>4+1 p...</summary><p>4+1 page paper plus Appendices and Supplementary zip file.

SysML v2 introduces enhanced structural modularity and formal semantics, offering a stronger foundation for interoperable modeling. Meanwhile, GPT-based Large Language Models (LLMs) provide new capabilities for assisting model understanding and integration. This paper proposes a structured, prompt-driven approach for LLM-assisted semantic alignment of SysML v2 models. The core contribution lies in the iterative development of an alignment approach and interaction prompts, incorporating model extraction, semantic matching, and verification. The approach leverages SysML v2 constructs such as alias, import, and metadata extensions to support traceable, soft alignment integration. It is demonstrated with a GPT-based LLM through an example of a measurement system.

Common evaluation methods, such as usability testing and inspection, are effective but resource-intensive and require expert involvement. This makes them less accessible for smaller organizations. Recent advances in multimodal LLMs offer promising opportunities to automate usability evaluation processes partly by analyzing textual, visual, and structural aspects of software interfaces. To investigate this possibility, we formulate usability evaluation as a recommendation task, where multimodal LLMs rank usability issues by severity. We conducted an initial proof-of-concept study to compare LLM-generated usability improvement recommendations with usability expert assessments. Our findings indicate the potential of LLMs to enable faster and more cost-effective usability evaluation, which makes it a practical alternative in contexts with limited expert resources.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Fools are Certain; the Wise are Doubtful: Exploring LLM Confidence in Code Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16131v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code completion entails the task of providing missing tokens given a surrounding context. It can boost developer productivity while providing a powerful code discovery tool. Following the Large Language Model (LLM) wave, code completion has been approached with diverse LLMs fine-tuned on code (code LLMs). The performance of code LLMs can be assessed with downstream and intrinsic metrics. Downstream metrics are usually employed to evaluate the practical utility of a model, but can be unreliable and require complex calculations and domain-specific knowledge. In contrast, intrinsic metrics such as perplexity, entropy, and mutual information, which measure model confidence or uncertainty, are simple, versatile, and universal across LLMs and tasks, and can serve as proxies for functional correctness and hallucination risk in LLM-generated code. Motivated by this, we evaluate the confidence of LLMs when generating code by measuring code perplexity across programming languages, models, and datasets using various LLMs, and a sample of 1008 files from 657 GitHub projects. We find that strongly-typed languages exhibit lower perplexity than dynamically typed languages. Scripting languages also demonstrate higher perplexity. Perl appears universally high in perplexity, whereas Java appears low. Code perplexity depends on the employed LLM, but not on the code dataset. Although code comments often increase perplexity, the language ranking based on perplexity is barely affected by their presence. LLM researchers, developers, and users can employ our findings to assess the benefits and suitability of LLM-based code completion in specific software projects based on how language, model choice, and code characteristics impact model confidence.</p></details> | 30 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Leveraging Large Language Models to Detect Missed Peephole Optimizations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16125v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By replacing small, suboptimal instruction sequences within programs with a more efficient equivalent, peephole optimization can not only directly optimize code size and performance, but also potentially enables further transformations in the subsequent optimization pipeline. Although peephole optimization is a critical class of compiler optimizations, discovering new and effective peephole optimizations is challenging as the instruction sets can be extremely complex and diverse. Previous methods either do not scale well or can only capture a limited subset of peephole optimizations. In this work, we leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect missed peephole optimizations. We propose Lampo, a novel automated framework that synergistically combines the creative but unreliable code optimization ability of LLMs with rigorous correctness verification performed by translation validation tools, integrated in a feedback-driven iterative process. Through a comprehensive evaluation within LLVM ecosystems, we show that Lampo can successfully detect up to 17 out of 25 previously reported missed optimizations in LLVM on average, and that 22 out of 25 can potentially be found by Lampo with different LLMs. For comparison, the state-of-the-art superoptimizer for LLVM, Souper, identified 15 of them. Moreover, within seven months of development and intermittent experiments, Lampo found 26 missed peephole optimizations, 15 of which have been confirmed and 6 already fixed. These results demonstrate Lampo's strong potential in continuously detecting missed peephole optimizations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Validating Terrain Models in Digital Twins for Trustworthy sUAS Operations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16104v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing deployment of small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) in unfamiliar and complex environments, Environmental Digital Twins (EDT) that comprise weather, airspace, and terrain data are critical for safe flight planning and for maintaining appropriate altitudes during search and surveillance operations. With the expansion of sUAS capabilities through edge and cloud computing, accurate EDT are also vital for advanced sUAS capabilities, like geolocation. However, real-world sUAS deployment introduces significant sources of uncertainty, necessitating a robust validation process for EDT components. This paper focuses on the validation of terrain models, one of the key components of an EDT, for real-world sUAS tasks. These models are constructed by fusing U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) datasets and satellite imagery, incorporating high-resolution environmental data to support mission tasks. Validating both the terrain models and their operational use by sUAS under real-world conditions presents significant challenges, including limited data granularity, terrain discontinuities, GPS and sensor inaccuracies, visual detection uncertainties, as well as onboard resources and timing constraints. We propose a 3-Dimensions validation process grounded in software engineering principles, following a workflow across granularity of tests, simulation to real world, and the analysis of simple to edge conditions. We demonstrate our approach using a multi-sUAS platform equipped with a Terrain-Aware Digital Shadow.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to EDTconf 2025</p></details> |
| **[From Benchmark Data To Applicable Program Repair: An Experience Report](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16071v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper describes our approach to automated program repair. We combine various techniques from the literature to achieve this. Our experiments show that our approach performs better than other techniques on standard benchmarks. However, on closer inspection, none of these techniques work on realistic defects that we see in industry. We find that augmenting code with formal specifications enables LLMs to generate higher-quality unit tests, especially for complex production code with improved coverage of edge cases and exception handling. However, specifications add little value for well-understood errors (e.g., null pointer, index out of bounds), but are beneficial for logic and string manipulation errors. Despite encouraging benchmark results, real-world adoption is limited since passing tests do not guarantee correct patches. Current challenges include insufficient expressiveness of the JML specification language, necessitating advanced verification tools and richer predicates. Our ongoing work is exploring contract automata, programming by example, and testcase repair, with a focus on integrating human feedback and measuring productivity gains - highlighting the gap between academic benchmarks and practical industry needs</p></details> |  |
| **[Measuring the effectiveness of code review comments in GitHub repositories: A machine learning approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16053v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper illustrates an empirical study of the working efficiency of machine learning techniques in classifying code review text by semantic meaning. The code review comments from the source control repository in GitHub were extracted for development activity from the existing year for three open-source projects. Apart from that, programmers need to be aware of their code and point out their errors. In that case, it is a must to classify the sentiment polarity of the code review comments to avoid an error. We manually labelled 13557 code review comments generated by three open source projects in GitHub during the existing year. In order to recognize the sentiment polarity (or sentiment orientation) of code reviews, we use seven machine learning algorithms and compare those results to find the better ones. Among those Linear Support Vector Classifier(SVC) classifier technique achieves higher accuracy than others. This study will help programmers to make any solution based on code reviews by avoiding misconceptions.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents an AI-driven framework that automates test case generation and validation using natural language processing (NLP), reinforcement learning (RL), and predictive models, embedded within a policy-driven trust and fairness model. The approach translates natural language requirements into executable tests, continuously optimizes them through learning, and validates outcomes with real-time analysis while mitigating bias. Case studies demonstrate measurable gains in defect detection, reduced testing effort, and faster release cycles, showing that AI-enhanced testing improves both efficiency and reliability. By addressing integration and scalability challenges, the framework illustrates how AI can shift testing from a reactive, manual process to a proactive, adaptive system that strengthens software quality in increasingly complex environments.</p></details> | 10 Pages |
| **[A Systematic Literature Review of Machine Learning Approaches for Migrating Monolithic Systems to Microservices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15941v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scalability and maintainability challenges in monolithic systems have led to the adoption of microservices, which divide systems into smaller, independent services. However, migrating existing monolithic systems to microservices is a complex and resource-intensive task, which can benefit from machine learning (ML) to automate some of its phases. Choosing the right ML approach for migration remains challenging for practitioners. Previous works studied separately the objectives, artifacts, techniques, tools, and benefits and challenges of migrating monolithic systems to microservices. No work has yet investigated systematically existing ML approaches for this migration to understand the \revised{automated migration phases}, inputs used, ML techniques applied, evaluation processes followed, and challenges encountered. We present a systematic literature review (SLR) that aggregates, synthesises, and discusses the approaches and results of 81 primary studies (PSs) published between 2015 and 2024. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement to report our findings and answer our research questions (RQs). We extract and analyse data from these PSs to answer our RQs. We synthesise the findings in the form of a classification that shows the usage of ML techniques in migrating monolithic systems to microservices. The findings reveal that some phases of the migration process, such as monitoring and service identification, are well-studied, while others, like packaging microservices, remain unexplored. Additionally, the findings highlight key challenges, including limited data availability, scalability and complexity constraints, insufficient tool support, and the absence of standardized benchmarking, emphasizing the need for more holistic solutions.</p></details> |  |

Current methods on PCR mainly focus on the reviewer's perspective, including finding a capable reviewer, predicting comment quality, and recommending/generating review comments. However, it is not well studied that how to satisfy the review necessity requests posted by developers which can increase their visibility, which in turn acts as a prerequisite for better review responses. To this end, we propose K nowledge-guided P rompt learning for P ublic Code Review (KP-PCR) to achieve developer-based code review request quality assurance (i.e., predicting request necessity and recommending tags subtask). Specifically, we reformulate the two subtasks via 1) text prompt tuning which converts both of them into a Masked Language Model (MLM) by constructing prompt templates using hard prompt; and 2) knowledge and code prefix tuning which introduces knowledge guidance from fine-tuned large language models by soft prompt, and uses program dependence graph to characterize code snippets. Finally, both of the request necessity prediction and tag recommendation subtasks output predicted results through an answer engineering module. In addition, we further analysis the time complexity of our KP-PCR that has lightweight prefix based the operation of introducing knowledge guidance. Experimental results on the PCR dataset for the period 2011-2023 demonstrate that our KP-PCR outperforms baselines by 2.3%-8.4% in the request necessity prediction and by 1.4%-6.9% in the tag recommendation. The code implementation is released at https://github.com/WUT-IDEA/KP-PCR.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 5 images, 12 tables, Manuscript revision submitted to a journal (2025)</p></details> |

A systems engineering approach is considered to address the growing need for quantum-secure telecommunications that overcome the threat to encryption caused by maturing quantum computation. This work explores a range of existing and future quantum communication networks, specifically quantum key distribution network proposals, to model and demonstrate the evolution of quantum key distribution network architectures. Leveraging Orthogonal Variability Modelling and Systems Modelling Language as candidate modelling languages, the study creates traceable artefacts to promote modular architectures that are reusable for future studies. We propose a variability-driven framework for managing fast-evolving network architectures with respect to increasing stakeholder expectations.

| **[Learning to Generate Unit Tests for Automated Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01619v3)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unit tests (UTs) play an instrumental role in assessing code correctness as well as providing feedback to large language models (LLMs), motivating automated test generation. However, we uncover a trade-off between generating unit test inputs that reveal errors when given a faulty code and correctly predicting the unit test output without access to the gold solution. To address this trade-off, we propose UTGen, which teaches LLMs to generate unit test inputs that reveal errors along with their correct expected outputs based on task descriptions. Since model-generated tests can provide noisy signals (e.g., from incorrectly predicted outputs), we propose UTDebug that (i) scales UTGen via test-time compute to improve UT output prediction, and (ii) validates and backtracks edits based on multiple generated UTs to avoid overfitting, and helps LLMs debug effectively. We show that UTGen outperforms other LLM-based baselines by 7.59% based on a metric measuring the presence of both error-revealing UT inputs and correct UT outputs. When used with UTDebug, we find that feedback from UTGen's unit tests improves pass@1 accuracy of Qwen2.5 32B on HumanEvalFix and our own harder debugging split of MBPP+ by over 3.17% and 12.35% (respectively) over other LLM-based UT generation baselines. Moreover, we observe that feedback from Qwen2.5 32B-based UTGen model can enhance debugging with frontier LLMs like GPT-4o by 13.8%. Lastly, we demonstrate that UTGen is a better judge for code correctness, outperforming a state-of-the-art trained 8B reward model by 4.43% on HumanEval+ with best-of-10 sampling using Qwen2.5 7B.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLM 2025.

Hooks are a set of APIs that manage side effects in function components in React. However, their semantics are often seen as opaque to developers, leading to UI bugs. We introduce React-tRace, a formalization of the semantics of the essence of React Hooks, providing a semantics that clarifies their behavior. We demonstrate that our model captures the behavior of React, by theoretically showing that it embodies essential properties of Hooks and empirically comparing our React-tRace-definitional interpreter against a test suite. Furthermore, we showcase a practical visualization tool based on the formalization to demonstrate how developers can better understand the semantics of Hooks.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in OOPSLA2 2025</p></details> |

To cope with these incidents, it is important to timely detect their occurrences, localize the sources of the problems, and implement the appropriate countermeasures. This paper reports our experience with a state-of-the-art failure prediction method, PREVENT, and its extension with a troubleshooting module, REACT, applied to naval systems developed by Fincantieri. Our results show how to integrate anomaly detection with troubleshooting procedures. We conclude by discussing a lesson learned, which may help deploy and extend these analyses to other industrial products.</p></details> |  |

Technical debt (TD) items are constructs in a software system providing short-term benefits but hindering future changes. TD management (TDM) is frequently researched but rarely adopted in practice. Goal. This study aimed to establish a TDM process in an IT company based on a predefined workshop concept. We analyzed which research approaches practitioners adopted for each TD activity and the TDM's long-term effect on TD awareness. Method. We used action research (five action cycles in 16 months) with an IT team that creates IT solutions for signal processing. To examine TD awareness, we (1) analyzed questionnaires completed during each workshop, (2) observed team meetings, (3) adopted a method from psychology for measuring awareness in decision-making situations called TD-SAGAT, and (4) evaluated the backlog data. Results. Practitioners preferred TD repayment and prioritization based on the system's evolution and cost calculations, i.e., repayment of so-called low-hanging fruits. Reminders in the backlog items, such as checkboxes or text templates, led to a sustainable rise in TD awareness. Conclusions. We showed that a workshop-based approach is feasible and leads to sustainable process changes. New ideas for TDM applicable to other IT teams emerged, e.g., using a re-submission date, using a Talked about TD checkbox, and using visualizations for TD prioritization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication by the Journal of Systems and Software -- Special Issue on Managing Technical Debt in Software-Intensive Products and Services</p></details> |
| **[HEAS: Hierarchical Evolutionary Agent Simulation Framework for Cross-Scale Modeling and Multi-Objective Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15555v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hierarchical Evolutionary Agent Simulation (HEAS) is a Python framework that unifies layered agent-based modeling with evolutionary optimization and tournament evaluation in a single, reproducible workflow. HEAS represents models as hierarchies of lightweight processes ("streams") scheduled in deterministic layers that read and write a shared context, making cross-scale couplings explicit and auditable. A compact API and CLI-simulate, optimize, evaluate-expose single- and multi-objective evolution, PyTorch policy integration via parameter flattening/unflattening, and general tournament tooling with user-defined scoring and voting rules. The framework standardizes evaluation through uniform per-step and episode metrics, persists seeds, logbooks, and hall-of-fame archives, and provides plotting helpers for traces, Pareto fronts, and comparative outcomes, reducing glue code and improving comparability across studies. HEAS emphasizes separation of mechanism from orchestration, allowing exogenous drivers, endogenous agents, and aggregators to be composed and swapped without refactoring, while the same model can be used for forward simulation, optimization, or systematic comparison. We illustrate usage with two compact examples-an ecological system and an enterprise decision-making setting. HEAS offers a practical foundation for cross-disciplinary, multi-level inquiry, yielding reliable, reproducible results.</p></details> | 9 pages, 1 figure |
| **[A Novel Mutation Based Method for Detecting FPGA Logic Synthesis Tool Bugs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15536v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) logic synthesis tools are key components in the EDA (Electronic Design Automation) toolchain. They convert hardware designs written in description languages such as Verilog into gate-level representations for FPGAs. However, defects in these tools may lead to unexpected behaviors and pose security risks. Therefore, it is crucial to harden these tools through testing. Although several methods have been proposed to automatically test FPGA logic synthesis tools, the challenge remains of insufficient semantic and logical complexity in test programs. In this paper, we propose VERMEI, a new method for testing FPGA logic synthesis tools. VERMEI consists of three modules: preprocessing, equivalent mutation, and bug identification. The preprocessing module identifies zombie logic (inactive code with no impact on the circuit output) in seed programs through simulation and coverage analysis. The equivalent mutation module generates equivalent variants of seed programs by pruning or inserting logic fragments in zombie areas. It uses Bayesian sampling to extract logic fragments from historical Verilog designs, making the generated variants have complex control flows and structures. The bug identification module, based on differential testing, compares the synthesized outputs of seed and variant programs to identify bugs. Experiments on Yosys, Vivado, and Quartus demonstrate that VERMEI outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Within five months, VERMEI reported 15 bugs to vendors, 9 of which were confirmed as new.</p></details> |  |

Unfortunately, many studies show that maintainability often receives less attention than its importance warrants. We argue that requirements engineering can address this gap the problem by fostering discussions and setting appropriate targets in a responsible manner. In this preliminary work, we conducted an exploratory study of industry practices related to requirements engineering for maintainability. Our findings confirm previous studies: maintainability remains a second-class quality concern. Explicit requirements often make sweeping references to coding conventions. Tools providing maintainability proxies are common but typically only used in implicit requirements related to engineering practices. To address this, we propose QUPER-MAn, a maintainability adaption of the QUPER model, which was originally developed to help organizations set targets for performance requirements. Developed using a design science approach, QUPER-MAn, integrates maintainability benchmarks and supports target setting. We posit that it can shift maintainability from an overlooked development consequence to an actively managed goal driven by informed and responsible engineering decisions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 1st International Workshop on Responsible Software Engineering</p></details> |

We present a community effort to scope this space, introducing a taxonomy of LLM-based study types together with eight guidelines for designing and reporting empirical studies involving LLMs. The guidelines present essential (must) criteria as well as desired (should) criteria and target transparency throughout the research process. Our recommendations, contextualized by our study types, are: (1) to declare LLM usage and role; (2) to report model versions, configurations, and fine-tuning; (3) to document tool architectures; (4) to disclose prompts and interaction logs; (5) to use human validation; (6) to employ an open LLM as a baseline; (7) to report suitable baselines, benchmarks, and metrics; and (8) to openly articulate limitations and mitigations. Our goal is to enable reproducibility and replicability despite LLM-specific barriers to open science. We maintain the study types and guidelines online as a living resource for the community to use and shape (llm-guidelines.org).</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft of evaluation guidelines for empirical studies in software engineering involving LLMs (see also llm-guidelines.org)</p></details> |

The emerging automated quality assessment techniques targeting chatbots often rely on limited pools of subjects, such as custom-made toy examples, or outdated, no longer available, or scarcely popular agents, complicating the evaluation of such techniques. In this paper, we present two datasets and the tool support necessary to create and maintain these datasets. The first dataset is RASA TASK-BASED CHATBOTS FROM GITHUB (TOFU-R), which is a snapshot of the Rasa chatbots available on GitHub, representing the state of the practice in open-source chatbot development with Rasa.

Due to the near real-time response requirements of this task, base models with small to medium-sized parameters are typically employed, supplemented by various optimization and post-training techniques. However, these optimization methods often have trade-offs, leading to a seesaw effect where performance improvements on certain datasets or metrics are accompanied by degradations on others -- sometimes even falling below the baseline model's performance. This paper proposes SynthCoder, a model that integrates leading industry practices to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) code completion task. In specific, we first construct a diverse dataset by combining Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) node extraction with heuristics that simulate developer behavior. Then we enrich our training corpus with cross-file contextual information using the BM25 algorithm and call graphs, enhancing the model's ability to perform code completion in both file-level and repository-level scenarios. As the last step, we employ a two-stage training process using the Seed-Coder-8B-Base as the base model. First, we fine-tune the model using Curriculum Learning technology. Following this, we perform alignment using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with preference pairs generated through Rejection Sampling. Experimental results demonstrate that our final model excels on mainstream repository-level code completion benchmarks, including aiXcoder, ExecRepoBench, CrossCodeEval, and CoLT. Furthermore, our carefully curated training set effectively mitigates the model's tendency to just repeat existing code, a common issue existing in various code completion models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Innamark: A Whitespace Replacement Information-Hiding Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12710v3)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant popularity in recent years. Differentiating between a text written by a human and one generated by an LLM has become almost impossible. Information-hiding techniques such as digital watermarking or steganography can help by embedding information inside text in a form that is unlikely to be noticed. However, existing techniques, such as linguistic-based or format-based methods, change the semantics or cannot be applied to pure, unformatted text. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for information hiding called Innamark, which can conceal any byte-encoded sequence within a sufficiently long cover text. This method is implemented as a multi-platform library using the Kotlin programming language, which is accompanied by a command-line tool and a web interface. By substituting conventional whitespace characters with visually similar Unicode whitespace characters, our proposed scheme preserves the semantics of the cover text without changing the number of characters. Furthermore, we propose a specified structure for secret messages that enables configurable compression, encryption, hashing, and error correction. An experimental benchmark comparison on a dataset of 1 000 000 Wikipedia articles compares ten algorithms. The results demonstrate the robustness of our proposed Innamark method in various applications and the imperceptibility of its watermarks to humans. We discuss the limits to the embedding capacity and robustness of the algorithm and how these could be addressed in future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and published in the IEEE Access journal as extended version of doi:10.24251/HICSS.2025.886</p></details> |

However, deploying these PLMs in large-scale applications faces practical challenges due to their computational intensity and inference latency. Knowledge distillation (KD), a promising model compression and acceleration technique, addresses these limitations by transferring knowledge from large teacher models to compact student models, enabling efficient inference while preserving most of the teacher models' capabilities. While this technique has shown remarkable success in natural language processing and computer vision domains, its potential for code understanding tasks remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we systematically investigate the effectiveness and usage of KD in code understanding tasks. Our study encompasses two popular types of KD methods, i.e., logit-based and feature-based KD methods, experimenting across eight student models and two teacher PLMs from different domains on three downstream tasks. The experimental results indicate that KD consistently offers notable performance boosts across student models with different sizes compared with standard fine-tuning. Notably, code-specific PLM demonstrates better effectiveness as the teacher model. Among all KD methods, the latest feature-based KD methods exhibit superior performance, enabling student models to retain up to 98% teacher performance with merely 5% parameters. Regarding student architecture, our experiments reveal that similarity with teacher architecture does not necessarily lead to better performance. We further discuss the efficiency and behaviors in the KD process and inference, summarize the implications of findings, and identify promising future directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICSE 2026 (Cycle 1)</p></details> |

However, GenAI faces several major challenges in developing reliable and efficient GenAI-empowered systems due to its unpredictability and inefficiency. This paper advocates for a paradigm shift: future GenAI-native systems should integrate GenAI's cognitive capabilities with traditional software engineering principles to create robust, adaptive, and efficient systems. We introduce foundational GenAI-native design principles centered around five key pillars -- reliability, excellence, evolvability, self-reliance, and assurance -- and propose architectural patterns such as GenAI-native cells, organic substrates, and programmable routers to guide the creation of resilient and self-evolving systems. Additionally, we outline the key ingredients of a GenAI-native software stack and discuss the impact of these systems from technical, user adoption, economic, and legal perspectives, underscoring the need for further validation and experimentation. Our work aims to inspire future research and encourage relevant communities to implement and refine this conceptual framework.</p></details> |  |

They often allow attackers to achieve arbitrary code execution by redirecting a vulnerable program's control flow. While Control Flow Integrity (CFI) has gained traction to mitigate this exploitation path, developers are not provided with any direction on how to apply CFI to real-world software. In this work, we establish a taxonomy mapping LLVM's forward-edge CFI variants to memory corruption vulnerability classes, offering actionable guidance for developers seeking to deploy CFI incrementally in existing codebases. Based on the Top 10 Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) list, we identify four high-impact vulnerability categories and select one representative CVE for each. We evaluate LLVM's CFI against each CVE and explain why CFI blocks exploitation in two cases while failing in the other two, illustrating its potential and current limitations. Our findings support informed deployment decisions and provide a foundation for improving the practical use of CFI in production systems.</p></details> |  |

However, its broader adoption faces considerable challenges, particularly concerning alignment between test generation methodologies and software requirements. REquirements-Driven Automated Software Testing (REDAST) addresses this gap by systematically leveraging requirements as the foundation for automated test artifact generation. This systematic literature review (SLR) critically examines the REDAST landscape, analyzing the current state of requirements input formats, transformation techniques, generated test artifacts, evaluation methods, and prevailing limitations. We conducted a thorough analysis of 156 relevant studies selected through a rigorous multi-stage filtering process from an initial collection of 27,333 papers sourced from six major research databases. Our findings highlight the predominance of functional requirements, model-based specifications, and natural language formats. Rule-based techniques are extensively utilized, while machine learning-based approaches remain relatively underexplored. Furthermore, most existing frameworks are sequential and dependent on singular intermediate representations, and while test cases, structured textual formats, and requirements coverage are common, full automation remains rare. We identify significant gaps related to automation completeness and dependency on input quality. This comprehensive synthesis provides a detailed overview of REDAST research and limitations, offering clear, evidence-based recommendations to guide future advancements in automated software testing.</p></details> | Accepted by TOSEM |
| **[On the need to perform comprehensive evaluations of automated program repair benchmarks: Sorald case study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15135v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In supporting the development of high-quality software, especially necessary in the era of LLMs, automated program repair (APR) tools aim to improve code quality by automatically addressing violations detected by static analysis profilers. Previous research tends to evaluate APR tools only for their ability to clear violations, neglecting their potential introduction of new (sometimes severe) violations, changes to code functionality and degrading of code structure. There is thus a need for research to develop and assess comprehensive evaluation frameworks for APR tools. This study addresses this research gap, and evaluates Sorald (a state-of-the-art APR tool) as a proof of concept. Sorald's effectiveness was evaluated in repairing 3,529 SonarQube violations across 30 rules within 2,393 Java code snippets extracted from Stack Overflow. Outcomes show that while Sorald fixes specific rule violations, it introduced 2,120 new faults (32 bugs, 2088 code smells), reduced code functional correctness--as evidenced by a 24% unit test failure rate--and degraded code structure, demonstrating the utility of our framework. Findings emphasize the need for evaluation methodologies that capture the full spectrum of APR tool effects, including side effects, to ensure their safe and effective adoption.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Out-of-Distribution Detection in Real-time Object Detection: From Benchmark Pitfalls to a New Mitigation Paradigm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07330v3)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-distribution (OoD) inputs pose a persistent challenge to deep learning models, often triggering overconfident predictions on non-target objects. While prior work has primarily focused on refining scoring functions and adjusting test-time thresholds, such algorithmic improvements offer only incremental gains. We argue that a rethinking of the entire development lifecycle is needed to mitigate these risks effectively. This work addresses two overlooked dimensions of OoD detection in object detection. First, we reveal fundamental flaws in widely used evaluation benchmarks: contrary to their design intent, up to 13% of objects in the OoD test sets actually belong to in-distribution classes, and vice versa. These quality issues severely distort the reported performance of existing methods and contribute to their high false positive rates. Second, we introduce a novel training-time mitigation paradigm that operates independently of external OoD detectors. Instead of relying solely on post-hoc scoring, we fine-tune the detector using a carefully synthesized OoD dataset that semantically resembles in-distribution objects. This process shapes a defensive decision boundary by suppressing objectness on OoD objects, leading to a 91% reduction in hallucination error of a YOLO model on BDD-100K. Our methodology generalizes across detection paradigms such as YOLO, Faster R-CNN, and RT-DETR, and supports few-shot adaptation. Together, these contributions offer a principled and effective way to reduce OoD-induced hallucination in object detectors.

| **[Correctness-Guaranteed Code Generation via Constrained Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15866v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language Models (LMs) are increasingly being used for code generation, but ensuring the correctness of generated programs remains a significant challenge. Although imperfect code may be acceptable during software development with human oversight, domains such as video games and robotics require one-shot correctness for runtime-critical components. We present a constrained decoding algorithm for generating semantically correct programs that incorporates a context-sensitive parser, which, at each step, outputs a regular expression that satisfies a critical non-extensible property to guide the generation of the next token sequence that can continue to a correct program. To build such a context-sensitive parser, we propose a framework of a dynamic tree of parsers (ToP) during parsing, where each parser corresponds to a modular context-free grammar enriched with contextual information such as variable scopes and type constraints, with tree branches representing ambiguity in the future code segment. We demonstrate our approach through sLua, a strongly typed variant of Lua, showing that our method can generate semantically correct programs conforming to any prescribed scripting API. We further show that, with careful design, our semantic guarantees extend to runtime correctness, as validated in the application of generating game mechanics for a roguelike video game.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at COLM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Action Engine: Automatic Workflow Generation in FaaS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19485v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Function as a Service (FaaS) is poised to become the foundation of the next generation of cloud systems due to its inherent advantages in scalability, cost-efficiency, and ease of use. However, challenges such as the need for specialized knowledge, platform dependence, and difficulty in scalability in building functional workflows persist for cloud-native application developers. To overcome these challenges and mitigate the burden of developing FaaS-based applications, in this paper, we propose a mechanism called Action Engine, that makes use of tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) at its kernel to interpret human language queries and automates FaaS workflow generation, thereby, reducing the need for specialized expertise and manual design. Action Engine includes modules to identify relevant functions from the FaaS repository and seamlessly manage the data dependency between them, ensuring the developer's query is processed and resolved. Beyond that, Action Engine can execute the generated workflow by injecting the user-provided arguments. On another front, this work addresses a gap in tool-augmented LLM research via adopting an Automatic FaaS Workflow Generation perspective to systematically evaluate methodologies across four fundamental sub-processes. Through benchmarking various parameters, this research provides critical insights into streamlining workflow automation for real-world applications, specifically in the FaaS continuum. Our evaluations demonstrate that the Action Engine achieves comparable performance to the few-shot learning approach while maintaining platform- and language-agnosticism, thereby, mitigating provider-specific dependencies in workflow generation. We notice that Action Engine can unlock FaaS workflow generation for non-cloud-savvy developers and expedite the development cycles of cloud-native applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Future Generation Computer Systems (FGCS) journal; Source code is available at: https://github.com/hpcclab/action_engine</p></details> |

This requirement reflects a growing consensus that cybersecurity researchers must go beyond providing capabilities to anticipating and mitigating the potential harms thereof. However, many cybersecurity researchers may be uncertain about how to proceed in an ethics analysis. In this guide, we provide practical support for that requirement by enumerating stakeholder types and mapping them to common empirical research methods. We also offer worked examples to demonstrate how researchers can identify likely stakeholder exposures in real-world projects. Our goal is to help research teams meet new ethics mandates with confidence and clarity, not confusion.</p></details> |  |

This study investigates whether explanation needs, classified from user reviews, can be predicted based on app properties, enabling early consideration during development and large-scale requirements mining. We analyzed a gold standard dataset of 4,495 app reviews enriched with metadata (e.g., app version, ratings, age restriction, in-app purchases). Correlation analyses identified mostly weak associations between app properties and explanation needs, with moderate correlations only for specific features such as app version, number of reviews, and star ratings. Linear regression models showed limited predictive power, with no reliable forecasts across configurations. Validation on a manually labeled dataset of 495 reviews confirmed these findings. Categories such as Security & Privacy and System Behavior showed slightly higher predictive potential, while Interaction and User Interface remained most difficult to predict. Overall, our results highlight that explanation needs are highly context-dependent and cannot be precisely inferred from app metadata alone. Developers and requirements engineers should therefore supplement metadata analysis with direct user feedback to effectively design explainable and user-centered software systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at the 33rd IEEE International Requirements Engineering Workshop (REW 2025)</p></details> |

However, achieving realistic and useful simulations comes with significant challenges. To explore these challenges, we conducted a workshop with experts in the field, allowing them to brainstorm key obstacles. Following this, we distributed a survey to consolidate findings and gain further insights into potential solutions. The experts identified 17 key challenges, along with proposed solutions, an assessment of whether they represent next steps for research, and the roadblocks to their implementation. While a lack of resources was not initially highlighted as a major challenge, utilizing more resources emerged as a critical necessity when experts discussed solutions. Interestingly, we expected some of these challenges to have already been addressed or to have systematic solutions readily available, given the collective expertise in the field. Many of the identified problems already have known solutions, allowing us to shift focus towards unresolved challenges and share the next steps with the broader community.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is supported by Sweden's innovation agency, Vinnova, under Grant No. 2021-05043 entitled "Enabling Virtual Validation and Verification for ADAS and AD Features (EVIDENT)."</p></details> |
| **[Assessing the Quality and Security of AI-Generated Code: A Quantitative Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14727v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a quantitative evaluation of the code quality and security of five prominent Large Language Models (LLMs): Claude Sonnet 4, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT-4o, Llama 3.2 90B, and OpenCoder 8B. While prior research has assessed the functional performance of LLM-generated code, this research tested LLM output from 4,442 Java coding assignments through comprehensive static analysis using SonarQube. The findings suggest that although LLMs can generate functional code, they also introduce a range of software defects, including bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code smells. These defects do not appear to be isolated; rather, they may represent shared weaknesses stemming from systemic limitations within current LLM code generation methods. In particular, critically severe issues, such as hard-coded passwords and path traversal vulnerabilities, were observed across multiple models. These results indicate that LLM-generated code requires verification in order to be considered production-ready. This study found no direct correlation between a model's functional performance (measured by Pass@1 rate of unit tests) and the overall quality and security of its generated code, measured by the number of SonarQube issues in benchmark solutions that passed the functional tests. This suggests that functional benchmark performance score is not a good indicator of overall code quality and security. The goal of this study is not to rank LLM performance but to highlight that all evaluated models appear to share certain weaknesses. Consequently, these findings support the view that static analysis can be a valuable instrument for detecting latent defects and an important safeguard for organizations that deploy AI in software development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a DSL to Formalize Multimodal Requirements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14631v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal systems, which process multiple input types such as text, audio, and images, are becoming increasingly prevalent in software systems, enabled by the huge advancements in Machine Learning. This triggers the need to easily define the requirements linked to these new types of user interactions, potentially involving more than one modality at the same time. This remains an open challenge due to the lack of languages and methods adapted to the diverse nature of multimodal interactions, with the risk of implementing AI-enhanced systems that do not properly satisfy the user needs. In this sense, this paper presents MERLAN, a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) to specify the requirements for these new types of multimodal interfaces. We present the metamodel for such language together with a textual syntax implemented as an ANTLR grammar. A prototype tool enabling requirements engineers to write such requirements and automatically generate a possible implementation of a system compliant with them on top of an agentic framework is also provided.</p></details> |  |

| **[Towards LLM-generated explanations for Component-based Knowledge Graph Question Answering Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14553v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over time, software systems have reached a level of complexity that makes it difficult for their developers and users to explain particular decisions made by them. In this paper, we focus on the explainability of component-based systems for Question Answering (QA). These components often conduct processes driven by AI methods, in which behavior and decisions cannot be clearly explained or justified, s.t., even for QA experts interpreting the executed process and its results is hard. To address this challenge, we present an approach that considers the components' input and output data flows as a source for representing the behavior and provide explanations for the components, enabling users to comprehend what happened. In the QA framework used here, the data flows of the components are represented as SPARQL queries (inputs) and RDF triples (outputs). Hence, we are also providing valuable insights on verbalization regarding these data types. In our experiments, the approach generates explanations while following template-based settings (baseline) or via the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) with different configurations (automatic generation). Our evaluation shows that the explanations generated via LLMs achieve high quality and mostly outperform template-based approaches according to the users' ratings. Therefore, it enables us to automatically explain the behavior and decisions of QA components to humans while using RDF and SPARQL as a context for explanations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at ICWI 2024, Zagreb.

| **[Post-hoc LLM-Supported Debugging of Distributed Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14540v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we address the problem of manual debugging, which nowadays remains resource-intensive and in some parts archaic. This problem is especially evident in increasingly complex and distributed software systems. Therefore, our objective of this work is to introduce an approach that can possibly be applied to any system, at both the macro- and micro-level, to ease this debugging process. This approach utilizes a system's process data, in conjunction with generative AI, to generate natural-language explanations. These explanations are generated from the actual process data, interface information, and documentation to guide the developers more efficiently to understand the behavior and possible errors of a process and its sub-processes. Here, we present a demonstrator that employs this approach on a component-based Java system. However, our approach is language-agnostic. Ideally, the generated explanations will provide a good understanding of the process, even if developers are not familiar with all the details of the considered system. Our demonstrator is provided as an open-source web application that is freely accessible to all users.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at ICWE 2025, Delft (30 June - 03 July 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Trace-Based Reconstruction of Quantum Circuit Dataflow in Surface Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14533v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Practical applications of quantum computing depend on fault-tolerant devices that employ error correction. A promising quantum error-correcting code for large-scale quantum computing is the surface code. For this code, Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing (FTQC) can be performed via lattice surgery, i.e. merging and splitting of encoded qubit patches on a 2D grid. Lattice surgery operations result in space-time patterns of activity that are defined in this work as access traces. This work demonstrates that the access traces reveal when, where, and how logical qubits interact. Leveraging this formulation, this work further introduces TraceQ, a trace-based reconstruction framework that is able to reconstruct the quantum circuit dataflow just by observing the patch activity at each trace entry. The framework is supported by heuristics for handling inherent ambiguity in the traces, and demonstrates its effectiveness on a range of synthetic fault-tolerant quantum benchmarks. The access traces can have applications in a wide range of scenarios, enabling analysis and profiling of execution of quantum programs and the hardware they run on. As one example use of TraceQ, this work investigates whether such traces can act as a side channel through which an observer can recover the circuit's structure and identify known subroutines in a larger program or even whole programs. The findings show that indeed the minimal access traces can be used to recover subroutines or even whole quantum programs with very high accuracy. Only a single trace per program execution is needed and the processing can be done fully offline. Along with the custom heuristics, advanced subgraph matching algorithms used in this work enable a high rate of locating the subroutines while executing in minimal time.</p></details> |  |

Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated their potential for enhancing the degree of automation in formal verification by, e.g., generating formal specifications as essential to deductive verification, yet exhibit poor scalability due to context-length limitations and, more importantly, the difficulty of inferring complex, interprocedural specifications. This paper outlines Preguss - a modular, fine-grained framework for automating the generation and refinement of formal specifications. Preguss synergizes between static analysis and deductive verification by orchestrating two components: (i) potential runtime error (RTE)-guided construction and prioritization of verification units, and (ii) LLM-aided synthesis of interprocedural specifications at the unit level. We envisage that Preguss paves a compelling path towards the automated verification of large-scale programs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Posit...</summary><p>Position paper to appear in the 1st International Workshop on Language Models and Programming Languages (LMPL '25)</p></details> |

Software today is often "illegible" - lacking a direct correspondence between code and observed behavior - and insufficiently modular, leading to a failure of three key requirements of robust coding: incrementality (the ability to deliver small increments by making localized changes), integrity (avoiding breaking prior increments) and transparency (making clear what has changed at build time, and what actions have happened at runtime). A new structural pattern offers improved legibility and modularity. Its elements are concepts and synchronizations: fully independent services and event-based rules that mediate between them. A domain-specific language for synchronizations allows behavioral features to be expressed in a granular and declarative way (and thus readily generated by an LLM). A case study of the RealWorld benchmark is used to illustrate and evaluate the approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages.

This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of the AirQo data pipeline: a modular, cloud-native Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) system engineered to support both real-time and batch processing of heterogeneous air quality data across urban deployments in Africa. It is Built using open-source technologies such as Apache Airflow, Apache Kafka, and Google BigQuery. The pipeline integrates diverse data streams from low-cost sensors, third-party weather APIs, and reference-grade monitors to enable automated calibration, forecasting, and accessible analytics. We demonstrate the pipeline's ability to ingest, transform, and distribute millions of air quality measurements monthly from over 400 monitoring devices while achieving low latency, high throughput, and robust data availability, even under constrained power and connectivity conditions. The paper details key architectural features, including workflow orchestration, decoupled ingestion layers, machine learning-driven sensor calibration, and observability frameworks. Performance is evaluated across operational metrics such as resource utilization, ingestion throughput, calibration accuracy, and data availability, offering practical insights into building sustainable environmental data platforms. By open-sourcing the platform and documenting deployment experiences, this work contributes a reusable blueprint for similar initiatives seeking to advance environmental intelligence through data engineering in low-resource settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 11 figures, 34th International Conference on Software Engineering and Data Engineering</p></details> |

However, these benchmarks primarily assess functional correctness and neglect broader dimensions of code quality, including security, reliability, readability, and maintainability. In this work, we systematically evaluate the ability of LLMs to generate high-quality code across multiple dimensions using the PythonSecurityEval benchmark. We introduce an iterative static analysis-driven prompting algorithm that leverages Bandit and Pylint to identify and resolve code quality issues. Our experiments with GPT-4o show substantial improvements: security issues reduced from >40% to 13%, readability violations from >80% to 11%, and reliability warnings from >50% to 11% within ten iterations. These results demonstrate that LLMs, when guided by static analysis feedback, can significantly enhance code quality beyond functional correctness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tuning Random Generators: Property-Based Testing as Probabilistic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14394v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Property-based testing validates software against an executable specification by evaluating it on randomly generated inputs. The standard way that PBT users generate test inputs is via generators that describe how to sample test inputs through random choices. To achieve a good distribution over test inputs, users must tune their generators, i.e., decide on the weights of these individual random choices. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to understand how to choose individual generator weights in order to achieve a desired distribution, so today this process is tedious and limits the distributions that can be practically achieved. In this paper, we develop techniques for the automatic and offline tuning of generators. Given a generator with undetermined symbolic weights and an objective function, our approach automatically learns values for these weights that optimize for the objective. We describe useful objective functions that allow users to (1) target desired distributions and (2) improve the diversity and validity of their test cases. We have implemented our approach in a novel discrete probabilistic programming system, Loaded Dice, that supports differentiation and parameter learning, and use it as a language for generators. We empirically demonstrate that our approach is effective at optimizing generator distributions according to the specified objective functions. We also perform a thorough evaluation on PBT benchmarks, demonstrating that, when automatically tuned for diversity and validity, the generators exhibit a 3.1-7.4x speedup in bug finding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of OOPSLA '25 paper</p></details> |

Within a short period, thousands of MCP services have already been developed and deployed. However, the client-server integration architecture inherent in MCP may expand the attack surface against LLM Agent systems, introducing new vulnerabilities that allow attackers to exploit by designing malicious MCP servers. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of attack vectors targeting the MCP ecosystem. Our analysis identifies four categories of attacks, i.e., Tool Poisoning Attacks, Puppet Attacks, Rug Pull Attacks, and Exploitation via Malicious External Resources. To evaluate the feasibility of these attacks, we conduct experiments following the typical steps of launching an attack through malicious MCP servers: upload-download-attack. Specifically, we first construct malicious MCP servers and successfully upload them to three widely used MCP aggregation platforms. The results indicate that current audit mechanisms are insufficient to identify and prevent the proposed attack methods. Next, through a user study and interview with 20 participants, we demonstrate that users struggle to identify malicious MCP servers and often unknowingly install them from aggregator platforms. Finally, we demonstrate that these attacks can trigger harmful behaviors within the user's local environment-such as accessing private files or controlling devices to transfer digital assets-by deploying a proof-of-concept (PoC) framework against five leading LLMs. Additionally, based on interview results, we discuss four key challenges faced by the current security ecosystem surrounding MCP servers. These findings underscore the urgent need for robust security mechanisms to defend against malicious MCP servers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Measuring LLM Code Generation Stability via Structural Entropy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14288v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assessing the stability of code generation from large language models (LLMs) is essential for judging their reliability in real-world development. We extend prior "structural-entropy concepts" to the program domain by pairing entropy with abstract syntax tree (AST) analysis. For any fixed prompt, we collect the multiset of depth-bounded subtrees of AST in each generated program and treat their relative frequencies as a probability distribution. We then measure stability in two complementary ways: (i) Jensen-Shannon divergence, a symmetric, bounded indicator of structural overlap, and (ii) a Structural Cross-Entropy ratio that highlights missing high-probability patterns. Both metrics admit structural-only and token-aware variants, enabling separate views on control-flow shape and identifier-level variability. Unlike pass@k, BLEU, or CodeBLEU, our metrics are reference-free, language-agnostic, and execution-independent. We benchmark several leading LLMs on standard code generation tasks, demonstrating that AST-driven structural entropy reveals nuances in model consistency and robustness. The method runs in O(n,d) time with no external tests, providing a lightweight addition to the code-generation evaluation toolkit.</p></details> | ASE-NIER |

In particular, fundamental knowledge of UML modeling and practice in creating high-quality UML diagrams are included in SE-relevant courses in the undergraduate programs of many universities. This leads to a time-consuming and labor-intensive task for educators to review and grade a large number of UML diagrams created by the students. Recent advancements in generative AI techniques, such as ChatGPT, have paved new ways to automate many SE tasks. However, current research or tools seldom explore the capabilities of ChatGPT in evaluating the quality of UML diagrams. This paper aims to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of ChatGPT in assessing the quality of UML use case diagrams, class diagrams, and sequence diagrams. First, 11 evaluation criteria with grading details were proposed for these UML diagrams. Next, a series of experiments were designed and conducted on 40 students' UML modeling reports to explore the performance of ChatGPT in evaluating and grading these UML diagrams. The research findings reveal that ChatGPT can complete this assessment task, but it cannot substitute for human experts yet. Meanwhile, there are five evaluation discrepancies between ChatGPT and human experts. These discrepancies vary in the use of different evaluation criteria in different types of UML diagrams, presenting ChatGPT's strength and weakness in this automatic evaluation task.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 6 images, 8 tables, Manuscript revision submitted to a journal (2025)</p></details> |
| **[Tight Inter-Core Cache Contention Analysis for WCET Estimation on Multicore Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13863v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>WCET (Worst-Case Execution Time) estimation on multicore architecture is particularly challenging mainly due to the complex accesses over cache shared by multiple cores. Existing analysis identifies possible contentions between parallel tasks by leveraging the partial order of the tasks or their program regions. Unfortunately, they overestimate the number of cache misses caused by a remote block access without considering the actual cache state and the number of accesses. This paper reports a new analysis for inter-core cache contention. Based on the order of program regions in a task, we first identify memory references that could be affected if a remote access occurs in a region. Afterwards, a fine-grained contention analysis is constructed that computes the number of cache misses based on the access quantity of local and remote blocks. We demonstrate that the overall inter-core cache interference of a task can be obtained via dynamic programming. Experiments show that compared to existing methods, the proposed analysis reduces inter-core cache interference and WCET estimations by 52.31% and 8.94% on average, without significantly increasing computation overhead.</p></details> |  |

The common way to review changes relies on examining code diffs, where textual differences between two file versions are highlighted in red and green to indicate additions and deletions of lines. This can be cumbersome for developers, making it difficult to obtain a comprehensive overview of all changes in a commit. Moreover, certain types of code changes can be particularly significant and may warrant differentiation from standard modifications to enhance code comprehension. We present a novel visualization approach supported by a tool named ChangePrism, which provides a way to better understand code changes. The tool comprises two components: extraction, which retrieves code changes and relevant information from the git history, and visualization, which offers both general and detailed views of code changes in commits. The general view provides an overview of different types of code changes across commits, while the detailed view displays the exact changes in the source code for each commit.</p></details> | <details><summary>(C) 2...</summary><p>(C) 2025 IEEE.

In this paper, we investigate the Maven Central ecosystem, one of the largest repositories of Java libraries, by applying network science techniques to its dependency graph. Leveraging the Goblin framework, we extracted a sample consisting of the top 5,000 highly connected artifacts based on their degree centrality and then performed breadth-first search (BFS) expansion from each selected artifact as a seed node, traversing the graph outward to capture all libraries and releases reachable those seed nodes. This sampling strategy captured the immediate structural context surrounding these libraries resulted in a curated graph comprising of 1.3 million nodes and 20.9 million edges. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of this graph, computing degree distributions, betweenness centrality, PageRank centrality, and connected components graph-theoretic metrics. Our results reveal that Maven Central exhibits a highly interconnected, scale-free, and small-world topology, characterized by a small number of infrastructural hubs that support the majority of projects. Further analysis using PageRank and betweenness centrality shows that these hubs predominantly consist of core ecosystem infrastructure, including testing frameworks and general-purpose utility libraries. While these hubs facilitate efficient software reuse and integration, they also pose systemic risks; failures or vulnerabilities affecting these critical nodes can have widespread and cascading impacts throughout the ecosystem.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, 34th International Conference on Software Engineering and Data Engineering</p></details> |

To ensure the quality of this information, SO encourages its users to review posts through various mechanisms (e.g., question and answer revision processes). Although Architecture Related Posts (ARPs) communicate architectural information that has a system-wide impact on development, little is known about how SO users revise information shared in ARPs. To fill this gap, we conducted an empirical study to understand how users revise Architecture Related Questions (ARQs) on SO. We manually checked 13,205 ARPs and finally identified 4,114 ARQs that contain revision information. Our main findings are that: (1) The revision of ARQs is not prevalent in SO, and an ARQ revision starts soon after this question is posted (i.e., from 1 minute onward). Moreover, the revision of an ARQ occurs before and after this question receives its first answer/architecture solution, with most revisions beginning before the first architecture solution is posted. Both Question Creators (QCs) and non-QCs actively participate in ARQ revisions, with most revisions being made by QCs. (2) A variety of information (14 categories) is missing and further provided in ARQs after being posted, among which design context, component dependency, and architecture concern are dominant information. (3) Clarify the understanding of architecture under design and improve the readability of architecture problem are the two major purposes of the further provided information in ARQs. (4) The further provided information in ARQs has several impacts on the quality of answers/architecture solutions, including making architecture solution useful, making architecture solution informative, making architecture solution relevant, among others.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint accepted for publication in Empirical Software Engineering, 2025</p></details> |

We introduce COMPASS (COdility's Multi-dimensional Programming ASSessment), a comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses code generation across three dimensions: correctness, efficiency, and quality. COMPASS consists of 50 competitive programming problems from real Codility competitions, providing authentic human baselines from 393,150 submissions. Unlike existing benchmarks that treat algorithmically inefficient solutions identically to optimal ones provided they pass test cases, COMPASS systematically evaluates runtime efficiency and code quality using industry-standard analysis tools. Our evaluation of three leading reasoning-enhanced models, Anthropic Claude Opus 4, Google Gemini 2.5 Pro, and OpenAI O4-Mini-High, reveals that models achieving high correctness scores do not necessarily produce efficient algorithms or maintainable code. These findings highlight the importance of evaluating more than just correctness to truly understand the real-world capabilities of code generation models. COMPASS serves as a guiding framework, charting a path for future research toward AI systems that are robust, reliable, and ready for production use.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tensor Program Optimization for the RISC-V Vector Extension Using Probabilistic Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01457v2)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RISC-V provides a flexible and scalable platform for applications ranging from embedded devices to high-performance computing clusters. Particularly, its RISC-V Vector Extension (RVV) becomes of interest for the acceleration of AI workloads. But writing software that efficiently utilizes the vector units of RISC-V CPUs without expert knowledge requires the programmer to rely on the autovectorization features of compilers or hand-crafted libraries like muRISCV-NN. Smarter approaches, like autotuning frameworks, have been missing the integration with the RISC-V RVV extension, thus heavily limiting the efficient deployment of complex AI workloads. In this paper, we present a workflow based on the TVM compiler to efficiently map AI workloads onto RISC-V vector units. Instead of relying on hand-crafted libraries, we integrated the RVV extension into TVM's MetaSchedule framework, a probabilistic program framework for tensor operation tuning. We implemented different RISC-V SoCs on an FPGA and tuned a wide range of AI workloads on them. We found that our proposal shows a mean improvement of 46% in execution latency when compared against the autovectorization feature of GCC, and 29% against muRISCV-NN. Moreover, the binary resulting from our proposal has a smaller code memory footprint, making it more suitable for embedded devices. Finally, we also evaluated our solution on a commercially available RISC-V SoC implementing the RVV 1.0 Vector Extension and found our solution is able to find mappings that are 35% faster on average than the ones proposed by LLVM. We open-sourced our proposal for the community to expand it to target other RISC-V extensions.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 10 figures, 2 algorithms</p></details> |
| **[The Hidden Cost of Readability: How Code Formatting Silently Consumes Your LLM Budget](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13666v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source code is usually formatted with elements like indentation and newlines to improve readability for human developers. However, these visual aids do not seem to be beneficial for large language models (LLMs) in the same way since the code is processed as a linear sequence of tokens. Furthermore, these additional tokens can lead to increased computational costs and longer response times for LLMs. If such formatting elements are non-essential to LLMs, we can reduce such costs by removing them from the code. To figure out the role played by formatting elements, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study to evaluate the impact of code formatting on LLM performance and efficiency. Through large-scale experiments on Fill-in-the-Middle Code Completion tasks across four programming languages (Java, Python, C++, C\#) and ten LLMs-including both commercial and open-source models-we systematically analyze token count and performance when formatting elements are removed. Key findings indicate that LLMs can maintain performance across formatted code and unformatted code, achieving an average input token reduction of 24.5\% with negligible output token reductions. This makes code format removal a practical optimization strategy for improving LLM efficiency. Further exploration reveals that both prompting and fine-tuning LLMs can lead to significant reductions (up to 36.1\%) in output code length without compromising correctness. To facilitate practical applications, we develop a bidirectional code transformation tool for format processing, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing LLM inference workflows, ensuring both human readability and LLM efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICSE'26 (First Cycle)</p></details> |

While various scoring systems exist to support this task, their differing goals, methodologies and outputs often lead to inconsistent prioritization decisions. This work provides the first large-scale, outcome-linked empirical comparison of four publicly available vulnerability scoring systems: the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), the Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization (SSVC), the Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS), and the Exploitability Index. We use a dataset of 600 real-world vulnerabilities derived from four months of Microsoft's Patch Tuesday disclosures to investigate the relationships between these scores, evaluate how they support vulnerability management task, how these scores categorize vulnerabilities across triage tiers, and assess their ability to capture the real-world exploitation risk. Our findings reveal significant disparities in how scoring systems rank the same vulnerabilities, with implications for organizations relying on these metrics to make data-driven, risk-based decisions. We provide insights into the alignment and divergence of these systems, highlighting the need for more transparent and consistent exploitability, risk, and severity assessments.</p></details> |  |

GPS treats the task of model checking a program as a directed search of the program states, guided by a compositional, summary-based static analysis. The summaries produced by static analysis are used both to prune away infeasible paths and to drive test generation to reach new, unexplored program states. GPS can find both proofs of safety and counter-examples to safety (i.e., inputs that trigger bugs), and features a novel two-layered search strategy that renders it particularly efficient at finding bugs in programs featuring long, input-dependent error paths. To make GPS refutationally complete (in the sense that it will find an error if one exists, if it is allotted enough time), we introduce an instrumentation technique and show that it helps GPS achieve refutation-completeness without sacrificing overall performance. We benchmarked GPS on a suite of benchmarks including both programs from the Software Verification Competition (SV-COMP) and from prior literature, and found that our implementation of GPS outperforms state-of-the-art software model checkers (including the top performers in SV-COMP ReachSafety-Loops category), both in terms of the number of benchmarks solved and in terms of running time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of paper in OOPSLA 2025 (with updated evaluations section compared to v1 manuscript). 37 pages</p></details> |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in mitigating this effort, existing LLM-based automated debugging methods underperform on industrial-scale modules. A major reason for this is bug signal dilution in long contexts, where a few bug-relevant tokens are overwhelmed by hundreds of unrelated lines, diffusing the model's attention. To address this issue, we introduce ARSP, a two-stage system that mitigates dilution via semantics-guided fragmentation. A Partition LLM splits a module into semantically tight fragments; a Repair LLM patches each fragment; edits are merged without altering unrelated logic. A synthetic data framework generates fragment-level training pairs spanning bug types, design styles, and scales to supervise both models. Experiments show that ARSP achieves 77.92% pass@1 and 83.88% pass@5, outperforming mainstream commercial LLMs including Claude-3.7 and SOTA automated Verilog debugging tools Strider and MEIC. Also, semantic partitioning improves pass@1 by 11.6% and pass@5 by 10.2% over whole-module debugging, validating the effectiveness of fragment-level scope reduction in LLM-based Verilog debugging.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Small is Enough? Empirical Evidence of Quantized Small Language Models for Automated Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16499v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved the accuracy of automated program repair (APR) methods. However, LLMs are constrained by high computational resource requirements. Aims: We focus on small language models (SLMs), which perform well even with limited computational resources compared to LLMs. We aim to evaluate whether SLMs can achieve competitive performance in APR tasks. Method: We conducted experiments on the QuixBugs benchmark to compare the bug-fixing accuracy of SLMs and LLMs. We also analyzed the impact of int8 quantization on APR performance. Results: The latest SLMs can fix bugs as accurately as--or even more accurately than--LLMs. Also, int8 quantization had minimal effect on APR accuracy while significantly reducing memory requirements. Conclusions: SLMs present a viable alternative to LLMs for APR, offering competitive accuracy with lower computational costs, and quantization can further enhance their efficiency without compromising effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoVerus: Automated Proof Generation for Rust Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13082v3)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI has shown its values for many software engineering tasks. Still in its infancy, large language model (LLM)-based proof generation lags behind LLM-based code generation. In this paper, we present AutoVerus. AutoVerus uses LLMs to automatically generate correctness proof for Rust code. AutoVerus is designed to match the unique features of Verus, a verification tool that can prove the correctness of Rust code using proofs and specifications also written in Rust. AutoVerus consists of a network of LLM agents that are crafted and orchestrated to mimic human experts' three phases of proof construction: preliminary proof generation, proof refinement guided by generic tips, and proof debugging guided by verification errors. To thoroughly evaluate AutoVerus and help foster future research in this direction, we have built a benchmark suite of 150 non-trivial proof tasks, based on existing code-generation benchmarks and verification benchmarks. Our evaluation shows that AutoVerus can automatically generate correct proof for more than 90% of them, with more than half of them tackled in less than 30 seconds or 3 LLM calls.</p></details> | OOPSLA 2025 |
| **[Using LLMs and Essence to Support Software Practice Adoption](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16445v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP) have enabled the development of automated tools that support various domains, including software engineering. However, while NLP and artificial intelligence (AI) research has extensively focused on tasks such as code generation, less attention has been given to automating support for the adoption of best practices, the evolution of ways of working, and the monitoring of process health. This study addresses this gap by exploring the integration of Essence, a standard and thinking framework for managing software engineering practices, with large language models (LLMs). To this end, a specialised chatbot was developed to assist students and professionals in understanding and applying Essence. The chatbot employs a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system to retrieve relevant contextual information from a curated knowledge base. Four different LLMs were used to create multiple chatbot configurations, each evaluated both as a base model and augmented with the RAG system. The system performance was evaluated through both the relevance of retrieved context and the quality of generated responses. Comparative analysis against the general-purpose LLMs demonstrated that the proposed system consistently outperforms its baseline counterpart in domain-specific tasks. By facilitating access to structured software engineering knowledge, this work contributes to bridging the gap between theoretical frameworks and practical application, potentially improving process management and the adoption of software development practices. While further validation through user studies is required, these findings highlight the potential of LLM-based automation to enhance learning and decision-making in software engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Classification or Prompting: A Case Study on Legal Requirements Traceability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04916v4)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>New regulations are introduced to ensure software development aligns with ethical concerns and protects public safety. Showing compliance requires tracing requirements to legal provisions. Requirements traceability is a key task where engineers must analyze technical requirements against target artifacts, often within limited time. Manually analyzing complex systems with hundreds of requirements is infeasible. The legal dimension adds challenges that increase effort. In this paper, we investigate two automated solutions based on language models, including large ones (LLMs). The first solution, Kashif, is a classifier that leverages sentence transformers and semantic similarity. The second solution, RICE_LRT, prompts a recent generative LLM based on RICE, a prompt engineering framework. On a benchmark dataset, we empirically evaluate Kashif and compare it against five different baseline classifiers from the literature. Kashif can identify trace links with a recall of 67%, precision of 50%, and F2 score of 63%, outperforming the best baseline by a substantial margin of 41 percentage points (pp) in F2. However, on unseen, more complex requirements documents traced to the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Kashif performs poorly, yielding an average recall of 15%, an average precision of 10%, and an average F2 score of 13.5%. On the same documents, however, our RICE solution yields an average recall of 84%, an average precision of 30%, and an average F2 score of 61%. RICE achieved a remarkable improvement of 47.5 pp over Kashif in terms of F2 score. Our results suggest that requirements traceability in the legal context cannot be simply addressed by building classifiers, as such solutions do not generalize and fail to perform well on complex regulations and requirements. Resorting to generative LLMs, with careful prompt engineering, is thus a more promising alternative.</p></details> | 38 pages, 4 figues |

Yet, their real-world effectiveness in detecting diverse software bugs, particularly complex, security-relevant vulnerabilities, remains underexplored. This study presents a systematic, empirical evaluation of these three leading LLMs using a benchmark of foundational programming errors, classic security flaws, and advanced, production-grade bugs in C++ and Python. The dataset integrates real code from SEED Labs, OpenSSL (via the Suresoft GLaDOS database), and PyBugHive, validated through local compilation and testing pipelines. A novel multi-stage, context-aware prompting protocol simulates realistic debugging scenarios, while a graded rubric measures detection accuracy, reasoning depth, and remediation quality. Our results show that all models excel at identifying syntactic and semantic issues in well-scoped code, making them promising for educational use and as first-pass reviewers in automated code auditing. Performance diminishes in scenarios involving complex security vulnerabilities and large-scale production code, with ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3 generally providing more nuanced contextual analyses than LLaMA 4. This highlights both the promise and the present constraints of LLMs in serving as reliable code analysis tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[AetherCode: Evaluating LLMs' Ability to Win In Premier Programming Competitions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16402v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Competitive programming has emerged as a critical benchmark for evaluating the reasoning and coding capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite impressive progress on existing benchmarks, we argue that current evaluations overstate model proficiency, masking a substantial gap between LLMs and elite human programmers. This gap arises from two key limitations: insufficient difficulty and scope of benchmark problems, and evaluation bias from low-quality test cases. To address these shortcomings, we present AetherCode, a new benchmark that draws problems from premier programming competitions such as IOI and ICPC, offering broader coverage and higher difficulty. AetherCode further incorporates comprehensive, expert-validated test suites built through a hybrid of automated generation and human curation, ensuring rigorous and reliable assessment. By combining challenging problem design with robust evaluation, AetherCode provides a more faithful measure of LLM capabilities and sets a new standard for future research in code reasoning.</p></details> | 15 pages |
| **[Mutation-Guided Unit Test Generation with a Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02954v4)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unit tests play a vital role in uncovering potential faults in software. While tools like EvoSuite focus on maximizing code coverage, recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shifted attention toward LLM-based test generation. However, code coverage metrics -- such as line and branch coverage -- remain overly emphasized in reported research, despite being weak indicators of a test suite's fault-detection capability. In contrast, mutation score offers a more reliable and stringent measure, as demonstrated in our findings where some test suites achieve 100% coverage but only 4% mutation score. Although a few studies consider mutation score, the effectiveness of LLMs in killing mutants remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose MUTGEN, a mutation-guided, LLM-based test generation approach that incorporates mutation feedback directly into the prompt. Evaluated on 204 subjects from two benchmarks, MUTGEN significantly outperforms both EvoSuite and vanilla prompt-based strategies in terms of mutation score. Furthermore, MUTGEN introduces an iterative generation mechanism that pushes the limits of LLMs in killing additional mutants. Our study also provide insights into the limitations of LLM-based generation, analyzing the reasons for live and uncovered mutants, and the impact of different mutation operators on generation effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

However, despite their strengths in test data generation, these tools are constrained by the types of test oracles they support, often limited to crashes, regressions, and noncompliance with API specifications or design standards. This paper introduces SATORI (Static API Test ORacle Inference), a black-box approach for generating test oracles for REST APIs by analyzing their OpenAPI Specification. SATORI uses large language models to infer the expected behavior of an API by analyzing the properties of the response fields of its operations, such as their name and descriptions. To foster its adoption, we extended the PostmanAssertify tool to automatically convert the test oracles reported by SATORI into executable assertions. Evaluation results on 17 operations from 12 industrial APIs show that SATORI can automatically generate up to hundreds of valid test oracles per operation. SATORI achieved an F1-score of 74.3%, outperforming the state-of-the-art dynamic approach AGORA+ (69.3%)-which requires executing the API-when generating comparable oracle types. Moreover, our findings show that static and dynamic oracle inference methods are complementary: together, SATORI and AGORA+ found 90% of the oracles in our annotated ground-truth dataset. Notably, SATORI uncovered 18 bugs in popular APIs (Amadeus Hotel, Deutschebahn, FDIC, GitLab, Marvel, OMDb and Vimeo) leading to documentation updates by the API maintainers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, ASE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Metamorphic Coverage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16307v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metamorphic testing is a widely used methodology that examines an expected relation between pairs of executions to automatically find bugs, such as correctness bugs. We found that code coverage cannot accurately measure the extent to which code is validated and mutation testing is computationally expensive for evaluating metamorphic testing methods. In this work, we propose Metamorphic Coverage (MC), a coverage metric that examines the distinct code executed by pairs of test inputs within metamorphic testing. Our intuition is that, typically, a bug can be observed if the corresponding code is executed when executing either test input but not the other one, so covering more differential code covered by pairs of test inputs might be more likely to expose bugs. While most metamorphic testing methods have been based on this general intuition, our work defines and systematically evaluates MC on five widely used metamorphic testing methods for testing database engines, compilers, and constraint solvers. The code measured by MC overlaps with the bug-fix locations of 50 of 64 bugs found by metamorphic testing methods, and MC has a stronger positive correlation with bug numbers than line coverage. MC is 4x more sensitive than line coverage in distinguishing testing methods' effectiveness, and the average value of MC is 6x smaller than line coverage while still capturing the part of the program that is being tested. MC required 359x less time than mutation testing. Based on a case study for an automated database system testing approach, we demonstrate that when used for feedback guidance, MC significantly outperforms code coverage, by finding 41\% more bugs. Consequently, this work might have broad applications for assessing metamorphic testing methods and improving test-case generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Systematic Mapping Study on Smart Cities Modeling Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16273v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Smart City concept was introduced to define an idealized city characterized by automation and connection. It then evolved rapidly by including further aspects, such as economy, environment. Since then, many publications have explored various aspects of Smart Cities across different application domains and research communities, acknowledging the interdisciplinary nature of this subject. In particular, our interest focuses on how smart cities are designed and modeled, as a whole or as regards with their subsystems, when dealing with the accomplishment of the research goals in this complex and heterogeneous domain. To this aim, we performed a systematic mapping study on smart cities modeling approaches identifying the relevant contributions (i) to get an overview of existing research approaches, (ii) to identify whether there are any publication trends, and (iii) to identify possible future research directions. We followed the guidelines for conducting systematic mapping studies by Petersen et al. to analyze smart cities modeling publications. Our analysis revealed the following main findings: (i) smart governance is the most investigated and modeled smart city dimension; (ii) the most used modeling approaches are business, architectural, and ontological modeling approaches, spanning multiple application fields; (iii) the great majority of existing technologies for modeling smart cities are not yet proven in operational environments; (iv) diverse research communities publish their results in a multitude of different venues which further motivates the presented literature study. Researchers can use our results for better understanding the state-of-the-art in modeling smart cities, and as a foundation for further analysis of specific approaches about smart cities modeling. Lastly, we also discuss the impact of our analysis for the Model-Driven Engineering community.</p></details> |  |

This challenge is amplified when targeting newer or less-documented GPU architectures where traditional development aids are scarce. This paper introduces an LLM-powered "GPU Kernel Scientist," an automated methodology for iteratively refining accelerator kernels. Our methodology employs LLMs in a multi-stage, evolutionary process: (a) strategically selecting promising prior code versions as a basis for new iterations; (b) generating hypotheses for optimization experiments, based on existing code and assimilated knowledge from general GPU literature; and (c) autonomously implementing these experiments through code modification and subsequent submission to an external evaluation system, using only observed timing data as performance feedback. We detail how this approach navigates the challenges of the AMD MI300 target architecture and leverages LLMs to compensate for limited domain-specific human expertise. In addition to our results, we present the architectural design, operational workflow, and qualitative insights, highlighting the potential of LLM-driven agents to democratise and accelerate GPU kernel optimization, especially in resource-constrained or rapidly updating hardware environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>4+1 p...</summary><p>4+1 page paper plus Appendices and Supplementary zip file.

Common evaluation methods, such as usability testing and inspection, are effective but resource-intensive and require expert involvement. This makes them less accessible for smaller organizations. Recent advances in multimodal LLMs offer promising opportunities to automate usability evaluation processes partly by analyzing textual, visual, and structural aspects of software interfaces. To investigate this possibility, we formulate usability evaluation as a recommendation task, where multimodal LLMs rank usability issues by severity. We conducted an initial proof-of-concept study to compare LLM-generated usability improvement recommendations with usability expert assessments. Our findings indicate the potential of LLMs to enable faster and more cost-effective usability evaluation, which makes it a practical alternative in contexts with limited expert resources.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Large Language Models to Detect Missed Peephole Optimizations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16125v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By replacing small, suboptimal instruction sequences within programs with a more efficient equivalent, peephole optimization can not only directly optimize code size and performance, but also potentially enables further transformations in the subsequent optimization pipeline. Although peephole optimization is a critical class of compiler optimizations, discovering new and effective peephole optimizations is challenging as the instruction sets can be extremely complex and diverse. Previous methods either do not scale well or can only capture a limited subset of peephole optimizations. In this work, we leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect missed peephole optimizations. We propose Lampo, a novel automated framework that synergistically combines the creative but unreliable code optimization ability of LLMs with rigorous correctness verification performed by translation validation tools, integrated in a feedback-driven iterative process. Through a comprehensive evaluation within LLVM ecosystems, we show that Lampo can successfully detect up to 17 out of 25 previously reported missed optimizations in LLVM on average, and that 22 out of 25 can potentially be found by Lampo with different LLMs. For comparison, the state-of-the-art superoptimizer for LLVM, Souper, identified 15 of them. Moreover, within seven months of development and intermittent experiments, Lampo found 26 missed peephole optimizations, 15 of which have been confirmed and 6 already fixed. These results demonstrate Lampo's strong potential in continuously detecting missed peephole optimizations.</p></details> |  |

With the expansion of sUAS capabilities through edge and cloud computing, accurate EDT are also vital for advanced sUAS capabilities, like geolocation. However, real-world sUAS deployment introduces significant sources of uncertainty, necessitating a robust validation process for EDT components. This paper focuses on the validation of terrain models, one of the key components of an EDT, for real-world sUAS tasks. These models are constructed by fusing U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) datasets and satellite imagery, incorporating high-resolution environmental data to support mission tasks. Validating both the terrain models and their operational use by sUAS under real-world conditions presents significant challenges, including limited data granularity, terrain discontinuities, GPS and sensor inaccuracies, visual detection uncertainties, as well as onboard resources and timing constraints. We propose a 3-Dimensions validation process grounded in software engineering principles, following a workflow across granularity of tests, simulation to real world, and the analysis of simple to edge conditions. We demonstrate our approach using a multi-sUAS platform equipped with a Terrain-Aware Digital Shadow.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to EDTconf 2025</p></details> |

We combine various techniques from the literature to achieve this. Our experiments show that our approach performs better than other techniques on standard benchmarks. However, on closer inspection, none of these techniques work on realistic defects that we see in industry. We find that augmenting code with formal specifications enables LLMs to generate higher-quality unit tests, especially for complex production code with improved coverage of edge cases and exception handling. However, specifications add little value for well-understood errors (e.g., null pointer, index out of bounds), but are beneficial for logic and string manipulation errors. Despite encouraging benchmark results, real-world adoption is limited since passing tests do not guarantee correct patches. Current challenges include insufficient expressiveness of the JML specification language, necessitating advanced verification tools and richer predicates. Our ongoing work is exploring contract automata, programming by example, and testcase repair, with a focus on integrating human feedback and measuring productivity gains - highlighting the gap between academic benchmarks and practical industry needs</p></details> |  |
| **[Breaking Barriers in Software Testing: The Power of AI-Driven Automation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16025v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software testing remains critical for ensuring reliability, yet traditional approaches are slow, costly, and prone to gaps in coverage. This paper presents an AI-driven framework that automates test case generation and validation using natural language processing (NLP), reinforcement learning (RL), and predictive models, embedded within a policy-driven trust and fairness model. The approach translates natural language requirements into executable tests, continuously optimizes them through learning, and validates outcomes with real-time analysis while mitigating bias. Case studies demonstrate measurable gains in defect detection, reduced testing effort, and faster release cycles, showing that AI-enhanced testing improves both efficiency and reliability. By addressing integration and scalability challenges, the framework illustrates how AI can shift testing from a reactive, manual process to a proactive, adaptive system that strengthens software quality in increasingly complex environments.</p></details> | 10 Pages |

However, migrating existing monolithic systems to microservices is a complex and resource-intensive task, which can benefit from machine learning (ML) to automate some of its phases. Choosing the right ML approach for migration remains challenging for practitioners. Previous works studied separately the objectives, artifacts, techniques, tools, and benefits and challenges of migrating monolithic systems to microservices. No work has yet investigated systematically existing ML approaches for this migration to understand the \revised{automated migration phases}, inputs used, ML techniques applied, evaluation processes followed, and challenges encountered. We present a systematic literature review (SLR) that aggregates, synthesises, and discusses the approaches and results of 81 primary studies (PSs) published between 2015 and 2024. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement to report our findings and answer our research questions (RQs). We extract and analyse data from these PSs to answer our RQs. We synthesise the findings in the form of a classification that shows the usage of ML techniques in migrating monolithic systems to microservices. The findings reveal that some phases of the migration process, such as monitoring and service identification, are well-studied, while others, like packaging microservices, remain unexplored. Additionally, the findings highlight key challenges, including limited data availability, scalability and complexity constraints, insufficient tool support, and the absence of standardized benchmarking, emphasizing the need for more holistic solutions.</p></details> |  |

We introduce React-tRace, a formalization of the semantics of the essence of React Hooks, providing a semantics that clarifies their behavior. We demonstrate that our model captures the behavior of React, by theoretically showing that it embodies essential properties of Hooks and empirically comparing our React-tRace-definitional interpreter against a test suite. Furthermore, we showcase a practical visualization tool based on the formalization to demonstrate how developers can better understand the semantics of Hooks.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in OOPSLA2 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Novel Mutation Based Method for Detecting FPGA Logic Synthesis Tool Bugs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15536v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) logic synthesis tools are key components in the EDA (Electronic Design Automation) toolchain. They convert hardware designs written in description languages such as Verilog into gate-level representations for FPGAs. However, defects in these tools may lead to unexpected behaviors and pose security risks. Therefore, it is crucial to harden these tools through testing. Although several methods have been proposed to automatically test FPGA logic synthesis tools, the challenge remains of insufficient semantic and logical complexity in test programs. In this paper, we propose VERMEI, a new method for testing FPGA logic synthesis tools. VERMEI consists of three modules: preprocessing, equivalent mutation, and bug identification. The preprocessing module identifies zombie logic (inactive code with no impact on the circuit output) in seed programs through simulation and coverage analysis. The equivalent mutation module generates equivalent variants of seed programs by pruning or inserting logic fragments in zombie areas. It uses Bayesian sampling to extract logic fragments from historical Verilog designs, making the generated variants have complex control flows and structures. The bug identification module, based on differential testing, compares the synthesized outputs of seed and variant programs to identify bugs. Experiments on Yosys, Vivado, and Quartus demonstrate that VERMEI outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Within five months, VERMEI reported 15 bugs to vendors, 9 of which were confirmed as new.</p></details> |  |

The emerging automated quality assessment techniques targeting chatbots often rely on limited pools of subjects, such as custom-made toy examples, or outdated, no longer available, or scarcely popular agents, complicating the evaluation of such techniques. In this paper, we present two datasets and the tool support necessary to create and maintain these datasets. The first dataset is RASA TASK-BASED CHATBOTS FROM GITHUB (TOFU-R), which is a snapshot of the Rasa chatbots available on GitHub, representing the state of the practice in open-source chatbot development with Rasa.

| **[ARSP: Automated Repair of Verilog Designs via Semantic Partitioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16517v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging functional Verilog bugs consumes a significant portion of front-end design time. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in mitigating this effort, existing LLM-based automated debugging methods underperform on industrial-scale modules. A major reason for this is bug signal dilution in long contexts, where a few bug-relevant tokens are overwhelmed by hundreds of unrelated lines, diffusing the model's attention. To address this issue, we introduce ARSP, a two-stage system that mitigates dilution via semantics-guided fragmentation. A Partition LLM splits a module into semantically tight fragments; a Repair LLM patches each fragment; edits are merged without altering unrelated logic. A synthetic data framework generates fragment-level training pairs spanning bug types, design styles, and scales to supervise both models. Experiments show that ARSP achieves 77.92% pass@1 and 83.88% pass@5, outperforming mainstream commercial LLMs including Claude-3.7 and SOTA automated Verilog debugging tools Strider and MEIC. Also, semantic partitioning improves pass@1 by 11.6% and pass@5 by 10.2% over whole-module debugging, validating the effectiveness of fragment-level scope reduction in LLM-based Verilog debugging.</p></details> |  |

Empirical Evidence of Quantized Small Language Models for Automated Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16499v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved the accuracy of automated program repair (APR) methods. However, LLMs are constrained by high computational resource requirements. Aims: We focus on small language models (SLMs), which perform well even with limited computational resources compared to LLMs. We aim to evaluate whether SLMs can achieve competitive performance in APR tasks. Method: We conducted experiments on the QuixBugs benchmark to compare the bug-fixing accuracy of SLMs and LLMs. We also analyzed the impact of int8 quantization on APR performance. Results: The latest SLMs can fix bugs as accurately as--or even more accurately than--LLMs. Also, int8 quantization had minimal effect on APR accuracy while significantly reducing memory requirements. Conclusions: SLMs present a viable alternative to LLMs for APR, offering competitive accuracy with lower computational costs, and quantization can further enhance their efficiency without compromising effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoVerus: Automated Proof Generation for Rust Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13082v3)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI has shown its values for many software engineering tasks. Still in its infancy, large language model (LLM)-based proof generation lags behind LLM-based code generation. In this paper, we present AutoVerus. AutoVerus uses LLMs to automatically generate correctness proof for Rust code. AutoVerus is designed to match the unique features of Verus, a verification tool that can prove the correctness of Rust code using proofs and specifications also written in Rust. AutoVerus consists of a network of LLM agents that are crafted and orchestrated to mimic human experts' three phases of proof construction: preliminary proof generation, proof refinement guided by generic tips, and proof debugging guided by verification errors. To thoroughly evaluate AutoVerus and help foster future research in this direction, we have built a benchmark suite of 150 non-trivial proof tasks, based on existing code-generation benchmarks and verification benchmarks. Our evaluation shows that AutoVerus can automatically generate correct proof for more than 90% of them, with more than half of them tackled in less than 30 seconds or 3 LLM calls.</p></details> | OOPSLA 2025 |
| **[Using LLMs and Essence to Support Software Practice Adoption](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16445v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP) have enabled the development of automated tools that support various domains, including software engineering. However, while NLP and artificial intelligence (AI) research has extensively focused on tasks such as code generation, less attention has been given to automating support for the adoption of best practices, the evolution of ways of working, and the monitoring of process health. This study addresses this gap by exploring the integration of Essence, a standard and thinking framework for managing software engineering practices, with large language models (LLMs). To this end, a specialised chatbot was developed to assist students and professionals in understanding and applying Essence. The chatbot employs a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system to retrieve relevant contextual information from a curated knowledge base. Four different LLMs were used to create multiple chatbot configurations, each evaluated both as a base model and augmented with the RAG system. The system performance was evaluated through both the relevance of retrieved context and the quality of generated responses. Comparative analysis against the general-purpose LLMs demonstrated that the proposed system consistently outperforms its baseline counterpart in domain-specific tasks. By facilitating access to structured software engineering knowledge, this work contributes to bridging the gap between theoretical frameworks and practical application, potentially improving process management and the adoption of software development practices. While further validation through user studies is required, these findings highlight the potential of LLM-based automation to enhance learning and decision-making in software engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Classification or Prompting: A Case Study on Legal Requirements Traceability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04916v4)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>New regulations are introduced to ensure software development aligns with ethical concerns and protects public safety. Showing compliance requires tracing requirements to legal provisions. Requirements traceability is a key task where engineers must analyze technical requirements against target artifacts, often within limited time. Manually analyzing complex systems with hundreds of requirements is infeasible. The legal dimension adds challenges that increase effort. In this paper, we investigate two automated solutions based on language models, including large ones (LLMs). The first solution, Kashif, is a classifier that leverages sentence transformers and semantic similarity. The second solution, RICE_LRT, prompts a recent generative LLM based on RICE, a prompt engineering framework. On a benchmark dataset, we empirically evaluate Kashif and compare it against five different baseline classifiers from the literature. Kashif can identify trace links with a recall of 67%, precision of 50%, and F2 score of 63%, outperforming the best baseline by a substantial margin of 41 percentage points (pp) in F2. However, on unseen, more complex requirements documents traced to the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Kashif performs poorly, yielding an average recall of 15%, an average precision of 10%, and an average F2 score of 13.5%. On the same documents, however, our RICE solution yields an average recall of 84%, an average precision of 30%, and an average F2 score of 61%. RICE achieved a remarkable improvement of 47.5 pp over Kashif in terms of F2 score. Our results suggest that requirements traceability in the legal context cannot be simply addressed by building classifiers, as such solutions do not generalize and fail to perform well on complex regulations and requirements. Resorting to generative LLMs, with careful prompt engineering, is thus a more promising alternative.</p></details> | 38 pages, 4 figues |

Yet, their real-world effectiveness in detecting diverse software bugs, particularly complex, security-relevant vulnerabilities, remains underexplored. This study presents a systematic, empirical evaluation of these three leading LLMs using a benchmark of foundational programming errors, classic security flaws, and advanced, production-grade bugs in C++ and Python. The dataset integrates real code from SEED Labs, OpenSSL (via the Suresoft GLaDOS database), and PyBugHive, validated through local compilation and testing pipelines. A novel multi-stage, context-aware prompting protocol simulates realistic debugging scenarios, while a graded rubric measures detection accuracy, reasoning depth, and remediation quality. Our results show that all models excel at identifying syntactic and semantic issues in well-scoped code, making them promising for educational use and as first-pass reviewers in automated code auditing. Performance diminishes in scenarios involving complex security vulnerabilities and large-scale production code, with ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3 generally providing more nuanced contextual analyses than LLaMA 4. This highlights both the promise and the present constraints of LLMs in serving as reliable code analysis tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[AetherCode: Evaluating LLMs' Ability to Win In Premier Programming Competitions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16402v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Competitive programming has emerged as a critical benchmark for evaluating the reasoning and coding capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite impressive progress on existing benchmarks, we argue that current evaluations overstate model proficiency, masking a substantial gap between LLMs and elite human programmers. This gap arises from two key limitations: insufficient difficulty and scope of benchmark problems, and evaluation bias from low-quality test cases. To address these shortcomings, we present AetherCode, a new benchmark that draws problems from premier programming competitions such as IOI and ICPC, offering broader coverage and higher difficulty. AetherCode further incorporates comprehensive, expert-validated test suites built through a hybrid of automated generation and human curation, ensuring rigorous and reliable assessment. By combining challenging problem design with robust evaluation, AetherCode provides a more faithful measure of LLM capabilities and sets a new standard for future research in code reasoning.</p></details> | 15 pages |

While tools like EvoSuite focus on maximizing code coverage, recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shifted attention toward LLM-based test generation. However, code coverage metrics -- such as line and branch coverage -- remain overly emphasized in reported research, despite being weak indicators of a test suite's fault-detection capability. In contrast, mutation score offers a more reliable and stringent measure, as demonstrated in our findings where some test suites achieve 100% coverage but only 4% mutation score. Although a few studies consider mutation score, the effectiveness of LLMs in killing mutants remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose MUTGEN, a mutation-guided, LLM-based test generation approach that incorporates mutation feedback directly into the prompt. Evaluated on 204 subjects from two benchmarks, MUTGEN significantly outperforms both EvoSuite and vanilla prompt-based strategies in terms of mutation score. Furthermore, MUTGEN introduces an iterative generation mechanism that pushes the limits of LLMs in killing additional mutants. Our study also provide insights into the limitations of LLM-based generation, analyzing the reasons for live and uncovered mutants, and the impact of different mutation operators on generation effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

This challenge is amplified when targeting newer or less-documented GPU architectures where traditional development aids are scarce. This paper introduces an LLM-powered "GPU Kernel Scientist," an automated methodology for iteratively refining accelerator kernels. Our methodology employs LLMs in a multi-stage, evolutionary process: (a) strategically selecting promising prior code versions as a basis for new iterations; (b) generating hypotheses for optimization experiments, based on existing code and assimilated knowledge from general GPU literature; and (c) autonomously implementing these experiments through code modification and subsequent submission to an external evaluation system, using only observed timing data as performance feedback. We detail how this approach navigates the challenges of the AMD MI300 target architecture and leverages LLMs to compensate for limited domain-specific human expertise. In addition to our results, we present the architectural design, operational workflow, and qualitative insights, highlighting the potential of LLM-driven agents to democratise and accelerate GPU kernel optimization, especially in resource-constrained or rapidly updating hardware environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>4+1 p...</summary><p>4+1 page paper plus Appendices and Supplementary zip file.

The core contribution lies in the iterative development of an alignment approach and interaction prompts, incorporating model extraction, semantic matching, and verification. The approach leverages SysML v2 constructs such as alias, import, and metadata extensions to support traceable, soft alignment integration. It is demonstrated with a GPT-based LLM through an example of a measurement system.

Common evaluation methods, such as usability testing and inspection, are effective but resource-intensive and require expert involvement. This makes them less accessible for smaller organizations. Recent advances in multimodal LLMs offer promising opportunities to automate usability evaluation processes partly by analyzing textual, visual, and structural aspects of software interfaces. To investigate this possibility, we formulate usability evaluation as a recommendation task, where multimodal LLMs rank usability issues by severity. We conducted an initial proof-of-concept study to compare LLM-generated usability improvement recommendations with usability expert assessments. Our findings indicate the potential of LLMs to enable faster and more cost-effective usability evaluation, which makes it a practical alternative in contexts with limited expert resources.</p></details> |  |

It can boost developer productivity while providing a powerful code discovery tool. Following the Large Language Model (LLM) wave, code completion has been approached with diverse LLMs fine-tuned on code (code LLMs). The performance of code LLMs can be assessed with downstream and intrinsic metrics. Downstream metrics are usually employed to evaluate the practical utility of a model, but can be unreliable and require complex calculations and domain-specific knowledge. In contrast, intrinsic metrics such as perplexity, entropy, and mutual information, which measure model confidence or uncertainty, are simple, versatile, and universal across LLMs and tasks, and can serve as proxies for functional correctness and hallucination risk in LLM-generated code. Motivated by this, we evaluate the confidence of LLMs when generating code by measuring code perplexity across programming languages, models, and datasets using various LLMs, and a sample of 1008 files from 657 GitHub projects. We find that strongly-typed languages exhibit lower perplexity than dynamically typed languages. Scripting languages also demonstrate higher perplexity. Perl appears universally high in perplexity, whereas Java appears low. Code perplexity depends on the employed LLM, but not on the code dataset. Although code comments often increase perplexity, the language ranking based on perplexity is barely affected by their presence. LLM researchers, developers, and users can employ our findings to assess the benefits and suitability of LLM-based code completion in specific software projects based on how language, model choice, and code characteristics impact model confidence.</p></details> | 30 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Leveraging Large Language Models to Detect Missed Peephole Optimizations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16125v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By replacing small, suboptimal instruction sequences within programs with a more efficient equivalent, peephole optimization can not only directly optimize code size and performance, but also potentially enables further transformations in the subsequent optimization pipeline. Although peephole optimization is a critical class of compiler optimizations, discovering new and effective peephole optimizations is challenging as the instruction sets can be extremely complex and diverse. Previous methods either do not scale well or can only capture a limited subset of peephole optimizations. In this work, we leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect missed peephole optimizations. We propose Lampo, a novel automated framework that synergistically combines the creative but unreliable code optimization ability of LLMs with rigorous correctness verification performed by translation validation tools, integrated in a feedback-driven iterative process. Through a comprehensive evaluation within LLVM ecosystems, we show that Lampo can successfully detect up to 17 out of 25 previously reported missed optimizations in LLVM on average, and that 22 out of 25 can potentially be found by Lampo with different LLMs. For comparison, the state-of-the-art superoptimizer for LLVM, Souper, identified 15 of them. Moreover, within seven months of development and intermittent experiments, Lampo found 26 missed peephole optimizations, 15 of which have been confirmed and 6 already fixed. These results demonstrate Lampo's strong potential in continuously detecting missed peephole optimizations.</p></details> |  |

Notably, all its subsystems are powered by ROS. The use of compatible interfaces and other ROS integration capabilities simplifies the construction of such systems. However, this only addresses part of the complexity: the semantic coherence and structural traceability are even more important for precise coordination and call for deliberate engineering methods. The Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) discipline, which emerged from the experience of complexity management in large-scale engineering domains, offers the methodological foundations needed. Despite their strengths in complementary aspects of robotics systems engineering, the lack of a unified approach to integrate ROS and MBSE hinders the full potential of these tools. Motivated by the anticipated impact of such a synergy in robotics practice, we propose a structured methodology based on MeROS - a SysML metamodel created specifically to put the ROS-based systems into the focus of the MBSE workflow. As its methodological backbone, we adapt the well-known V-model to this context, illustrating how complex robotic systems can be designed with traceability and validation capabilities embedded into their lifecycle using practices familiar to engineering teams.</p></details> | 22 pages |

GPS treats the task of model checking a program as a directed search of the program states, guided by a compositional, summary-based static analysis. The summaries produced by static analysis are used both to prune away infeasible paths and to drive test generation to reach new, unexplored program states. GPS can find both proofs of safety and counter-examples to safety (i.e., inputs that trigger bugs), and features a novel two-layered search strategy that renders it particularly efficient at finding bugs in programs featuring long, input-dependent error paths. To make GPS refutationally complete (in the sense that it will find an error if one exists, if it is allotted enough time), we introduce an instrumentation technique and show that it helps GPS achieve refutation-completeness without sacrificing overall performance. We benchmarked GPS on a suite of benchmarks including both programs from the Software Verification Competition (SV-COMP) and from prior literature, and found that our implementation of GPS outperforms state-of-the-art software model checkers (including the top performers in SV-COMP ReachSafety-Loops category), both in terms of the number of benchmarks solved and in terms of running time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of paper in OOPSLA 2025 (with updated evaluations section compared to v1 manuscript). 37 pages</p></details> |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in mitigating this effort, existing LLM-based automated debugging methods underperform on industrial-scale modules. A major reason for this is bug signal dilution in long contexts, where a few bug-relevant tokens are overwhelmed by hundreds of unrelated lines, diffusing the model's attention. To address this issue, we introduce ARSP, a two-stage system that mitigates dilution via semantics-guided fragmentation. A Partition LLM splits a module into semantically tight fragments; a Repair LLM patches each fragment; edits are merged without altering unrelated logic. A synthetic data framework generates fragment-level training pairs spanning bug types, design styles, and scales to supervise both models. Experiments show that ARSP achieves 77.92% pass@1 and 83.88% pass@5, outperforming mainstream commercial LLMs including Claude-3.7 and SOTA automated Verilog debugging tools Strider and MEIC. Also, semantic partitioning improves pass@1 by 11.6% and pass@5 by 10.2% over whole-module debugging, validating the effectiveness of fragment-level scope reduction in LLM-based Verilog debugging.</p></details> |  |

By decomposing a system into simpler, interacting agents, agent-based modeling (ABM) allows researchers to observe the emergence of complex phenomena. High-performance array computing libraries like JAX can help scale such computational models to a large number of agents by using automatic vectorization and just-in-time (JIT) compilation. One of the caveats of using JAX to achieve such scaling is that the shapes of arrays used in the computational model should remain immutable throughout the simulation. In the context of agent-based modeling (ABM), this can pose constraints on certain agent manipulation operations that require flexible data structures. A subset of which is represented by the ability to update a dynamically selected number of agents by applying distinct changes to them during a simulation. To this effect, we introduce Abmax, an ABM framework based on JAX that implements multiple just-in-time (JIT) compilable algorithms to provide this functionality. On the canonical predation model benchmark, Abmax achieves runtime performance comparable to state-of-the-art implementations. Further, we show that this functionality can also be vectorized, making it possible to run many similar agent-based models in parallel. We also present two examples in the form of a traffic-flow model and a financial market model to show the use case of Abmax.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables, 2 algorithms</p></details> |

Empirical Evidence of Quantized Small Language Models for Automated Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16499v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved the accuracy of automated program repair (APR) methods. However, LLMs are constrained by high computational resource requirements. Aims: We focus on small language models (SLMs), which perform well even with limited computational resources compared to LLMs. We aim to evaluate whether SLMs can achieve competitive performance in APR tasks. Method: We conducted experiments on the QuixBugs benchmark to compare the bug-fixing accuracy of SLMs and LLMs. We also analyzed the impact of int8 quantization on APR performance. Results: The latest SLMs can fix bugs as accurately as--or even more accurately than--LLMs. Also, int8 quantization had minimal effect on APR accuracy while significantly reducing memory requirements. Conclusions: SLMs present a viable alternative to LLMs for APR, offering competitive accuracy with lower computational costs, and quantization can further enhance their efficiency without compromising effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

Still in its infancy, large language model (LLM)-based proof generation lags behind LLM-based code generation. In this paper, we present AutoVerus. AutoVerus uses LLMs to automatically generate correctness proof for Rust code. AutoVerus is designed to match the unique features of Verus, a verification tool that can prove the correctness of Rust code using proofs and specifications also written in Rust. AutoVerus consists of a network of LLM agents that are crafted and orchestrated to mimic human experts' three phases of proof construction: preliminary proof generation, proof refinement guided by generic tips, and proof debugging guided by verification errors. To thoroughly evaluate AutoVerus and help foster future research in this direction, we have built a benchmark suite of 150 non-trivial proof tasks, based on existing code-generation benchmarks and verification benchmarks. Our evaluation shows that AutoVerus can automatically generate correct proof for more than 90% of them, with more than half of them tackled in less than 30 seconds or 3 LLM calls.</p></details> | OOPSLA 2025 |

However, while NLP and artificial intelligence (AI) research has extensively focused on tasks such as code generation, less attention has been given to automating support for the adoption of best practices, the evolution of ways of working, and the monitoring of process health. This study addresses this gap by exploring the integration of Essence, a standard and thinking framework for managing software engineering practices, with large language models (LLMs). To this end, a specialised chatbot was developed to assist students and professionals in understanding and applying Essence. The chatbot employs a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system to retrieve relevant contextual information from a curated knowledge base. Four different LLMs were used to create multiple chatbot configurations, each evaluated both as a base model and augmented with the RAG system. The system performance was evaluated through both the relevance of retrieved context and the quality of generated responses. Comparative analysis against the general-purpose LLMs demonstrated that the proposed system consistently outperforms its baseline counterpart in domain-specific tasks. By facilitating access to structured software engineering knowledge, this work contributes to bridging the gap between theoretical frameworks and practical application, potentially improving process management and the adoption of software development practices. While further validation through user studies is required, these findings highlight the potential of LLM-based automation to enhance learning and decision-making in software engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Classification or Prompting: A Case Study on Legal Requirements Traceability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04916v4)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>New regulations are introduced to ensure software development aligns with ethical concerns and protects public safety. Showing compliance requires tracing requirements to legal provisions. Requirements traceability is a key task where engineers must analyze technical requirements against target artifacts, often within limited time. Manually analyzing complex systems with hundreds of requirements is infeasible. The legal dimension adds challenges that increase effort. In this paper, we investigate two automated solutions based on language models, including large ones (LLMs). The first solution, Kashif, is a classifier that leverages sentence transformers and semantic similarity. The second solution, RICE_LRT, prompts a recent generative LLM based on RICE, a prompt engineering framework. On a benchmark dataset, we empirically evaluate Kashif and compare it against five different baseline classifiers from the literature. Kashif can identify trace links with a recall of 67%, precision of 50%, and F2 score of 63%, outperforming the best baseline by a substantial margin of 41 percentage points (pp) in F2. However, on unseen, more complex requirements documents traced to the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Kashif performs poorly, yielding an average recall of 15%, an average precision of 10%, and an average F2 score of 13.5%. On the same documents, however, our RICE solution yields an average recall of 84%, an average precision of 30%, and an average F2 score of 61%. RICE achieved a remarkable improvement of 47.5 pp over Kashif in terms of F2 score. Our results suggest that requirements traceability in the legal context cannot be simply addressed by building classifiers, as such solutions do not generalize and fail to perform well on complex regulations and requirements. Resorting to generative LLMs, with careful prompt engineering, is thus a more promising alternative.</p></details> | 38 pages, 4 figues |

Yet, their real-world effectiveness in detecting diverse software bugs, particularly complex, security-relevant vulnerabilities, remains underexplored. This study presents a systematic, empirical evaluation of these three leading LLMs using a benchmark of foundational programming errors, classic security flaws, and advanced, production-grade bugs in C++ and Python. The dataset integrates real code from SEED Labs, OpenSSL (via the Suresoft GLaDOS database), and PyBugHive, validated through local compilation and testing pipelines. A novel multi-stage, context-aware prompting protocol simulates realistic debugging scenarios, while a graded rubric measures detection accuracy, reasoning depth, and remediation quality. Our results show that all models excel at identifying syntactic and semantic issues in well-scoped code, making them promising for educational use and as first-pass reviewers in automated code auditing. Performance diminishes in scenarios involving complex security vulnerabilities and large-scale production code, with ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3 generally providing more nuanced contextual analyses than LLaMA 4. This highlights both the promise and the present constraints of LLMs in serving as reliable code analysis tools.</p></details> |  |

Despite impressive progress on existing benchmarks, we argue that current evaluations overstate model proficiency, masking a substantial gap between LLMs and elite human programmers. This gap arises from two key limitations: insufficient difficulty and scope of benchmark problems, and evaluation bias from low-quality test cases. To address these shortcomings, we present AetherCode, a new benchmark that draws problems from premier programming competitions such as IOI and ICPC, offering broader coverage and higher difficulty. AetherCode further incorporates comprehensive, expert-validated test suites built through a hybrid of automated generation and human curation, ensuring rigorous and reliable assessment. By combining challenging problem design with robust evaluation, AetherCode provides a more faithful measure of LLM capabilities and sets a new standard for future research in code reasoning.</p></details> | 15 pages |

We consider Mealy machines that have stochastic delays associated with each transition and explore how the learner can efficiently arrive at faithful estimates of those machines, the precision of which crucially relies on repetitive sampling of transition delays. While it is possible to na\"ively integrate the delay sampling into AAL algorithms such as $L^*$, this leads to considerable oversampling near the root of the state space. We address this problem by separating conceptually the learning of behavior and delays such that the learner uses the information gained while learning the logical behavior to arrive at efficient input sequences for collecting the needed delay samples. We put emphasis on treating cases in which identical input/output behaviors might stem from distinct delay characteristics. Finally, we provide empirical evidence that our method outperforms the na\"ive baseline across a wide range of benchmarks and investigate its applicability in a realistic setting by studying the join order in a relational database.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Integrated Formal Methods (iFM) 2025</p></details> |

This makes tool selection and architectural design decisions a complex problem, especially for large-scale software systems. To tackle this issue, we introduce CAPI, the Comprehensive Architecture Pattern Integration method that uses a diagnostic decision tree to suggest architectural patterns depending on user needs. By suggesting patterns instead of tools, the overall complexity for further decisions is lower as there are fewer architectural patterns than tools due to the abstract nature of patterns. Moreover, since tools implement patterns, each non-proposed pattern reduces the number of tools to choose from, reducing complexity. We iteratively developed CAPI, evaluating its understandability and usability in small studies with academic participants. When satisfied with the outcome, we performed a user-study with industry representatives to investigate the state-of-the-art in technology selection and the effectiveness of our proposed method. We find that technology selection is largely performed via trial and error, that CAPI is uniformly perceived as helpful, and that CAPI is able to reproduce the productive architectural environments of our participants.</p></details> |  |

Despite the popularity of MSA in the software industry, there is a limited evidence-based and thorough understanding of the types of issues (e.g., errors, faults, failures, and bugs) that microservices system developers experience, the causes of the issues, and the solutions as potential fixing strategies to address the issues. To ameliorate this gap, we conducted a mixed-methods empirical study that collected data from 2,641 issues from the issue tracking systems of 15 open-source microservices systems on GitHub, 15 interviews, and an online survey completed by 150 practitioners from 42 countries across 6 continents. Our analysis led to comprehensive taxonomies for the issues, causes, and solutions. The findings of this study informthat Technical Debt, Continuous Integration and Delivery, Exception Handling, Service Execution and Communication, and Security are the most dominant issues in microservices systems. Furthermore, General Programming Errors, Missing Features and Artifacts, and Invalid Configuration and Communication are the main causes behind the issues. Finally, we found 177 types of solutions that can be applied to fix the identified issues. Based on our study results, we formulated future research directions that could help researchers and practitioners to engineer emergent and next-generation microservices systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 5 images, 7 tables, Manuscript submitted to a Journal (2025)</p></details> |

While tools like EvoSuite focus on maximizing code coverage, recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shifted attention toward LLM-based test generation. However, code coverage metrics -- such as line and branch coverage -- remain overly emphasized in reported research, despite being weak indicators of a test suite's fault-detection capability. In contrast, mutation score offers a more reliable and stringent measure, as demonstrated in our findings where some test suites achieve 100% coverage but only 4% mutation score. Although a few studies consider mutation score, the effectiveness of LLMs in killing mutants remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose MUTGEN, a mutation-guided, LLM-based test generation approach that incorporates mutation feedback directly into the prompt. Evaluated on 204 subjects from two benchmarks, MUTGEN significantly outperforms both EvoSuite and vanilla prompt-based strategies in terms of mutation score. Furthermore, MUTGEN introduces an iterative generation mechanism that pushes the limits of LLMs in killing additional mutants. Our study also provide insights into the limitations of LLM-based generation, analyzing the reasons for live and uncovered mutants, and the impact of different mutation operators on generation effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

Kashif can identify trace links with a recall of 67%, precision of 50%, and F2 score of 63%, outperforming the best baseline by a substantial margin of 41 percentage points (pp) in F2. However, on unseen, more complex requirements documents traced to the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Kashif performs poorly, yielding an average recall of 15%, an average precision of 10%, and an average F2 score of 13.5%. On the same documents, however, our RICE solution yields an average recall of 84%, an average precision of 30%, and an average F2 score of 61%.

This highlights both the promise and the present constraints of LLMs in serving as reliable code analysis tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[AetherCode: Evaluating LLMs' Ability to Win In Premier Programming Competitions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16402v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Competitive programming has emerged as a critical benchmark for evaluating the reasoning and coding capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite impressive progress on existing benchmarks, we argue that current evaluations overstate model proficiency, masking a substantial gap between LLMs and elite human programmers. This gap arises from two key limitations: insufficient difficulty and scope of benchmark problems, and evaluation bias from low-quality test cases. To address these shortcomings, we present AetherCode, a new benchmark that draws problems from premier programming competitions such as IOI and ICPC, offering broader coverage and higher difficulty. AetherCode further incorporates comprehensive, expert-validated test suites built through a hybrid of automated generation and human curation, ensuring rigorous and reliable assessment. By combining challenging problem design with robust evaluation, AetherCode provides a more faithful measure of LLM capabilities and sets a new standard for future research in code reasoning.</p></details> | 15 pages |

We consider Mealy machines that have stochastic delays associated with each transition and explore how the learner can efficiently arrive at faithful estimates of those machines, the precision of which crucially relies on repetitive sampling of transition delays. While it is possible to na\"ively integrate the delay sampling into AAL algorithms such as $L^*$, this leads to considerable oversampling near the root of the state space. We address this problem by separating conceptually the learning of behavior and delays such that the learner uses the information gained while learning the logical behavior to arrive at efficient input sequences for collecting the needed delay samples. We put emphasis on treating cases in which identical input/output behaviors might stem from distinct delay characteristics. Finally, we provide empirical evidence that our method outperforms the na\"ive baseline across a wide range of benchmarks and investigate its applicability in a realistic setting by studying the join order in a relational database.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Integrated Formal Methods (iFM) 2025</p></details> |

Some of these systems are used in various sensitive environments to make life-changing decisions. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that these AI/ML systems do not make any discriminatory decisions for any specific groups or populations. In that vein, different bias detection and mitigation open-source software libraries (aka API libraries) are being developed and used. In this paper, we conduct a qualitative study to understand in what scenarios these open-source fairness APIs are used in the wild, how they are used, and what challenges the developers of these APIs face while developing and adopting these libraries. We have analyzed 204 GitHub repositories (from a list of 1885 candidate repositories) which used 13 APIs that are developed to address bias in ML software. We found that these APIs are used for two primary purposes (i.e., learning and solving real-world problems), targeting 17 unique use-cases. Our study suggests that developers are not well-versed in bias detection and mitigation; they face lots of troubleshooting issues, and frequently ask for opinions and resources. Our findings can be instrumental for future bias-related software engineering research, and for guiding educators in developing more state-of-the-art curricula.</p></details> |  |

This makes tool selection and architectural design decisions a complex problem, especially for large-scale software systems. To tackle this issue, we introduce CAPI, the Comprehensive Architecture Pattern Integration method that uses a diagnostic decision tree to suggest architectural patterns depending on user needs. By suggesting patterns instead of tools, the overall complexity for further decisions is lower as there are fewer architectural patterns than tools due to the abstract nature of patterns. Moreover, since tools implement patterns, each non-proposed pattern reduces the number of tools to choose from, reducing complexity. We iteratively developed CAPI, evaluating its understandability and usability in small studies with academic participants. When satisfied with the outcome, we performed a user-study with industry representatives to investigate the state-of-the-art in technology selection and the effectiveness of our proposed method. We find that technology selection is largely performed via trial and error, that CAPI is uniformly perceived as helpful, and that CAPI is able to reproduce the productive architectural environments of our participants.</p></details> |  |

Despite the popularity of MSA in the software industry, there is a limited evidence-based and thorough understanding of the types of issues (e.g., errors, faults, failures, and bugs) that microservices system developers experience, the causes of the issues, and the solutions as potential fixing strategies to address the issues. To ameliorate this gap, we conducted a mixed-methods empirical study that collected data from 2,641 issues from the issue tracking systems of 15 open-source microservices systems on GitHub, 15 interviews, and an online survey completed by 150 practitioners from 42 countries across 6 continents. Our analysis led to comprehensive taxonomies for the issues, causes, and solutions. The findings of this study informthat Technical Debt, Continuous Integration and Delivery, Exception Handling, Service Execution and Communication, and Security are the most dominant issues in microservices systems. Furthermore, General Programming Errors, Missing Features and Artifacts, and Invalid Configuration and Communication are the main causes behind the issues. Finally, we found 177 types of solutions that can be applied to fix the identified issues. Based on our study results, we formulated future research directions that could help researchers and practitioners to engineer emergent and next-generation microservices systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 5 images, 7 tables, Manuscript submitted to a Journal (2025)</p></details> |
| **[Mutation-Guided Unit Test Generation with a Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02954v4)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unit tests play a vital role in uncovering potential faults in software. While tools like EvoSuite focus on maximizing code coverage, recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shifted attention toward LLM-based test generation. However, code coverage metrics -- such as line and branch coverage -- remain overly emphasized in reported research, despite being weak indicators of a test suite's fault-detection capability. In contrast, mutation score offers a more reliable and stringent measure, as demonstrated in our findings where some test suites achieve 100% coverage but only 4% mutation score. Although a few studies consider mutation score, the effectiveness of LLMs in killing mutants remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose MUTGEN, a mutation-guided, LLM-based test generation approach that incorporates mutation feedback directly into the prompt. Evaluated on 204 subjects from two benchmarks, MUTGEN significantly outperforms both EvoSuite and vanilla prompt-based strategies in terms of mutation score. Furthermore, MUTGEN introduces an iterative generation mechanism that pushes the limits of LLMs in killing additional mutants. Our study also provide insights into the limitations of LLM-based generation, analyzing the reasons for live and uncovered mutants, and the impact of different mutation operators on generation effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[SATORI: Static Test Oracle Generation for REST APIs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16318v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>REST API test case generation tools are evolving rapidly, with growing capabilities for the automated generation of complex tests. However, despite their strengths in test data generation, these tools are constrained by the types of test oracles they support, often limited to crashes, regressions, and noncompliance with API specifications or design standards. This paper introduces SATORI (Static API Test ORacle Inference), a black-box approach for generating test oracles for REST APIs by analyzing their OpenAPI Specification. SATORI uses large language models to infer the expected behavior of an API by analyzing the properties of the response fields of its operations, such as their name and descriptions. To foster its adoption, we extended the PostmanAssertify tool to automatically convert the test oracles reported by SATORI into executable assertions. Evaluation results on 17 operations from 12 industrial APIs show that SATORI can automatically generate up to hundreds of valid test oracles per operation. SATORI achieved an F1-score of 74.3%, outperforming the state-of-the-art dynamic approach AGORA+ (69.3%)-which requires executing the API-when generating comparable oracle types. Moreover, our findings show that static and dynamic oracle inference methods are complementary: together, SATORI and AGORA+ found 90% of the oracles in our annotated ground-truth dataset. Notably, SATORI uncovered 18 bugs in popular APIs (Amadeus Hotel, Deutschebahn, FDIC, GitLab, Marvel, OMDb and Vimeo) leading to documentation updates by the API maintainers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, ASE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Metamorphic Coverage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16307v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metamorphic testing is a widely used methodology that examines an expected relation between pairs of executions to automatically find bugs, such as correctness bugs. We found that code coverage cannot accurately measure the extent to which code is validated and mutation testing is computationally expensive for evaluating metamorphic testing methods. In this work, we propose Metamorphic Coverage (MC), a coverage metric that examines the distinct code executed by pairs of test inputs within metamorphic testing. Our intuition is that, typically, a bug can be observed if the corresponding code is executed when executing either test input but not the other one, so covering more differential code covered by pairs of test inputs might be more likely to expose bugs. While most metamorphic testing methods have been based on this general intuition, our work defines and systematically evaluates MC on five widely used metamorphic testing methods for testing database engines, compilers, and constraint solvers. The code measured by MC overlaps with the bug-fix locations of 50 of 64 bugs found by metamorphic testing methods, and MC has a stronger positive correlation with bug numbers than line coverage. MC is 4x more sensitive than line coverage in distinguishing testing methods' effectiveness, and the average value of MC is 6x smaller than line coverage while still capturing the part of the program that is being tested. MC required 359x less time than mutation testing. Based on a case study for an automated database system testing approach, we demonstrate that when used for feedback guidance, MC significantly outperforms code coverage, by finding 41\% more bugs. Consequently, this work might have broad applications for assessing metamorphic testing methods and improving test-case generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Systematic Mapping Study on Smart Cities Modeling Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16273v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Smart City concept was introduced to define an idealized city characterized by automation and connection. It then evolved rapidly by including further aspects, such as economy, environment. Since then, many publications have explored various aspects of Smart Cities across different application domains and research communities, acknowledging the interdisciplinary nature of this subject. In particular, our interest focuses on how smart cities are designed and modeled, as a whole or as regards with their subsystems, when dealing with the accomplishment of the research goals in this complex and heterogeneous domain. To this aim, we performed a systematic mapping study on smart cities modeling approaches identifying the relevant contributions (i) to get an overview of existing research approaches, (ii) to identify whether there are any publication trends, and (iii) to identify possible future research directions. We followed the guidelines for conducting systematic mapping studies by Petersen et al. to analyze smart cities modeling publications. Our analysis revealed the following main findings: (i) smart governance is the most investigated and modeled smart city dimension; (ii) the most used modeling approaches are business, architectural, and ontological modeling approaches, spanning multiple application fields; (iii) the great majority of existing technologies for modeling smart cities are not yet proven in operational environments; (iv) diverse research communities publish their results in a multitude of different venues which further motivates the presented literature study. Researchers can use our results for better understanding the state-of-the-art in modeling smart cities, and as a foundation for further analysis of specific approaches about smart cities modeling. Lastly, we also discuss the impact of our analysis for the Model-Driven Engineering community.</p></details> |  |

These techniques typically require a normative process model as input, specifically designed for the processes to be analyzed. Such models are rarely available, though, and their creation involves considerable manual effort.However, reference process models serve as best-practice templates for organizational processes in a plethora of domains, containing valuable knowledge about general behavioral relations in well-engineered processes. These general models can thus mitigate the need for dedicated models by providing a basis to check for undesired behavior. Still, finding a perfectly matching reference model for a real-life event log is unrealistic because organizational needs can vary, despite similarities in process execution. Furthermore, event logs may encompass behavior related to different reference models, making traditional conformance checking impractical as it requires aligning process executions to individual models. To still use reference models for conformance checking, we propose a framework for mining declarative best-practice constraints from a reference model collection, automatically selecting constraints that are relevant for a given event log, and checking for best-practice violations. We demonstrate the capability of our framework to detect best-practice violations through an evaluation based on real-world process model collections and event logs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to Information Systems</p></details> |

This challenge is amplified when targeting newer or less-documented GPU architectures where traditional development aids are scarce. This paper introduces an LLM-powered "GPU Kernel Scientist," an automated methodology for iteratively refining accelerator kernels. Our methodology employs LLMs in a multi-stage, evolutionary process: (a) strategically selecting promising prior code versions as a basis for new iterations; (b) generating hypotheses for optimization experiments, based on existing code and assimilated knowledge from general GPU literature; and (c) autonomously implementing these experiments through code modification and subsequent submission to an external evaluation system, using only observed timing data as performance feedback. We detail how this approach navigates the challenges of the AMD MI300 target architecture and leverages LLMs to compensate for limited domain-specific human expertise. In addition to our results, we present the architectural design, operational workflow, and qualitative insights, highlighting the potential of LLM-driven agents to democratise and accelerate GPU kernel optimization, especially in resource-constrained or rapidly updating hardware environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>4+1 p...</summary><p>4+1 page paper plus Appendices and Supplementary zip file.

SysML v2 introduces enhanced structural modularity and formal semantics, offering a stronger foundation for interoperable modeling. Meanwhile, GPT-based Large Language Models (LLMs) provide new capabilities for assisting model understanding and integration. This paper proposes a structured, prompt-driven approach for LLM-assisted semantic alignment of SysML v2 models. The core contribution lies in the iterative development of an alignment approach and interaction prompts, incorporating model extraction, semantic matching, and verification. The approach leverages SysML v2 constructs such as alias, import, and metadata extensions to support traceable, soft alignment integration. It is demonstrated with a GPT-based LLM through an example of a measurement system. Benefits and limitations are discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE ISSE 2025, DOI pending</p></details> |

Common evaluation methods, such as usability testing and inspection, are effective but resource-intensive and require expert involvement. This makes them less accessible for smaller organizations. Recent advances in multimodal LLMs offer promising opportunities to automate usability evaluation processes partly by analyzing textual, visual, and structural aspects of software interfaces. To investigate this possibility, we formulate usability evaluation as a recommendation task, where multimodal LLMs rank usability issues by severity. We conducted an initial proof-of-concept study to compare LLM-generated usability improvement recommendations with usability expert assessments. Our findings indicate the potential of LLMs to enable faster and more cost-effective usability evaluation, which makes it a practical alternative in contexts with limited expert resources.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Fools are Certain; the Wise are Doubtful: Exploring LLM Confidence in Code Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16131v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code completion entails the task of providing missing tokens given a surrounding context. It can boost developer productivity while providing a powerful code discovery tool. Following the Large Language Model (LLM) wave, code completion has been approached with diverse LLMs fine-tuned on code (code LLMs). The performance of code LLMs can be assessed with downstream and intrinsic metrics. Downstream metrics are usually employed to evaluate the practical utility of a model, but can be unreliable and require complex calculations and domain-specific knowledge. In contrast, intrinsic metrics such as perplexity, entropy, and mutual information, which measure model confidence or uncertainty, are simple, versatile, and universal across LLMs and tasks, and can serve as proxies for functional correctness and hallucination risk in LLM-generated code. Motivated by this, we evaluate the confidence of LLMs when generating code by measuring code perplexity across programming languages, models, and datasets using various LLMs, and a sample of 1008 files from 657 GitHub projects. We find that strongly-typed languages exhibit lower perplexity than dynamically typed languages. Scripting languages also demonstrate higher perplexity. Perl appears universally high in perplexity, whereas Java appears low. Code perplexity depends on the employed LLM, but not on the code dataset. Although code comments often increase perplexity, the language ranking based on perplexity is barely affected by their presence. LLM researchers, developers, and users can employ our findings to assess the benefits and suitability of LLM-based code completion in specific software projects based on how language, model choice, and code characteristics impact model confidence.</p></details> | 30 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Leveraging Large Language Models to Detect Missed Peephole Optimizations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16125v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By replacing small, suboptimal instruction sequences within programs with a more efficient equivalent, peephole optimization can not only directly optimize code size and performance, but also potentially enables further transformations in the subsequent optimization pipeline. Although peephole optimization is a critical class of compiler optimizations, discovering new and effective peephole optimizations is challenging as the instruction sets can be extremely complex and diverse. Previous methods either do not scale well or can only capture a limited subset of peephole optimizations. In this work, we leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect missed peephole optimizations. We propose Lampo, a novel automated framework that synergistically combines the creative but unreliable code optimization ability of LLMs with rigorous correctness verification performed by translation validation tools, integrated in a feedback-driven iterative process. Through a comprehensive evaluation within LLVM ecosystems, we show that Lampo can successfully detect up to 17 out of 25 previously reported missed optimizations in LLVM on average, and that 22 out of 25 can potentially be found by Lampo with different LLMs. For comparison, the state-of-the-art superoptimizer for LLVM, Souper, identified 15 of them. Moreover, within seven months of development and intermittent experiments, Lampo found 26 missed peephole optimizations, 15 of which have been confirmed and 6 already fixed. These results demonstrate Lampo's strong potential in continuously detecting missed peephole optimizations.</p></details> |  |

With the expansion of sUAS capabilities through edge and cloud computing, accurate EDT are also vital for advanced sUAS capabilities, like geolocation. However, real-world sUAS deployment introduces significant sources of uncertainty, necessitating a robust validation process for EDT components. This paper focuses on the validation of terrain models, one of the key components of an EDT, for real-world sUAS tasks. These models are constructed by fusing U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) datasets and satellite imagery, incorporating high-resolution environmental data to support mission tasks. Validating both the terrain models and their operational use by sUAS under real-world conditions presents significant challenges, including limited data granularity, terrain discontinuities, GPS and sensor inaccuracies, visual detection uncertainties, as well as onboard resources and timing constraints. We propose a 3-Dimensions validation process grounded in software engineering principles, following a workflow across granularity of tests, simulation to real world, and the analysis of simple to edge conditions. We demonstrate our approach using a multi-sUAS platform equipped with a Terrain-Aware Digital Shadow.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to EDTconf 2025</p></details> |

We combine various techniques from the literature to achieve this. Our experiments show that our approach performs better than other techniques on standard benchmarks. However, on closer inspection, none of these techniques work on realistic defects that we see in industry. We find that augmenting code with formal specifications enables LLMs to generate higher-quality unit tests, especially for complex production code with improved coverage of edge cases and exception handling. However, specifications add little value for well-understood errors (e.g., null pointer, index out of bounds), but are beneficial for logic and string manipulation errors. Despite encouraging benchmark results, real-world adoption is limited since passing tests do not guarantee correct patches. Current challenges include insufficient expressiveness of the JML specification language, necessitating advanced verification tools and richer predicates. Our ongoing work is exploring contract automata, programming by example, and testcase repair, with a focus on integrating human feedback and measuring productivity gains - highlighting the gap between academic benchmarks and practical industry needs</p></details> |  |

The code review comments from the source control repository in GitHub were extracted for development activity from the existing year for three open-source projects. Apart from that, programmers need to be aware of their code and point out their errors. In that case, it is a must to classify the sentiment polarity of the code review comments to avoid an error. We manually labelled 13557 code review comments generated by three open source projects in GitHub during the existing year. In order to recognize the sentiment polarity (or sentiment orientation) of code reviews, we use seven machine learning algorithms and compare those results to find the better ones. Among those Linear Support Vector Classifier(SVC) classifier technique achieves higher accuracy than others. This study will help programmers to make any solution based on code reviews by avoiding misconceptions.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents an AI-driven framework that automates test case generation and validation using natural language processing (NLP), reinforcement learning (RL), and predictive models, embedded within a policy-driven trust and fairness model. The approach translates natural language requirements into executable tests, continuously optimizes them through learning, and validates outcomes with real-time analysis while mitigating bias. Case studies demonstrate measurable gains in defect detection, reduced testing effort, and faster release cycles, showing that AI-enhanced testing improves both efficiency and reliability. By addressing integration and scalability challenges, the framework illustrates how AI can shift testing from a reactive, manual process to a proactive, adaptive system that strengthens software quality in increasingly complex environments.</p></details> | 10 Pages |

However, migrating existing monolithic systems to microservices is a complex and resource-intensive task, which can benefit from machine learning (ML) to automate some of its phases. Choosing the right ML approach for migration remains challenging for practitioners. Previous works studied separately the objectives, artifacts, techniques, tools, and benefits and challenges of migrating monolithic systems to microservices. No work has yet investigated systematically existing ML approaches for this migration to understand the \revised{automated migration phases}, inputs used, ML techniques applied, evaluation processes followed, and challenges encountered. We present a systematic literature review (SLR) that aggregates, synthesises, and discusses the approaches and results of 81 primary studies (PSs) published between 2015 and 2024. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement to report our findings and answer our research questions (RQs). We extract and analyse data from these PSs to answer our RQs. We synthesise the findings in the form of a classification that shows the usage of ML techniques in migrating monolithic systems to microservices. The findings reveal that some phases of the migration process, such as monitoring and service identification, are well-studied, while others, like packaging microservices, remain unexplored. Additionally, the findings highlight key challenges, including limited data availability, scalability and complexity constraints, insufficient tool support, and the absence of standardized benchmarking, emphasizing the need for more holistic solutions.</p></details> |  |

Current methods on PCR mainly focus on the reviewer's perspective, including finding a capable reviewer, predicting comment quality, and recommending/generating review comments. However, it is not well studied that how to satisfy the review necessity requests posted by developers which can increase their visibility, which in turn acts as a prerequisite for better review responses. To this end, we propose K nowledge-guided P rompt learning for P ublic Code Review (KP-PCR) to achieve developer-based code review request quality assurance (i.e., predicting request necessity and recommending tags subtask). Specifically, we reformulate the two subtasks via 1) text prompt tuning which converts both of them into a Masked Language Model (MLM) by constructing prompt templates using hard prompt; and 2) knowledge and code prefix tuning which introduces knowledge guidance from fine-tuned large language models by soft prompt, and uses program dependence graph to characterize code snippets. Finally, both of the request necessity prediction and tag recommendation subtasks output predicted results through an answer engineering module. In addition, we further analysis the time complexity of our KP-PCR that has lightweight prefix based the operation of introducing knowledge guidance. Experimental results on the PCR dataset for the period 2011-2023 demonstrate that our KP-PCR outperforms baselines by 2.3%-8.4% in the request necessity prediction and by 1.4%-6.9% in the tag recommendation. The code implementation is released at https://github.com/WUT-IDEA/KP-PCR.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 5 images, 12 tables, Manuscript revision submitted to a journal (2025)</p></details> |

| **[Learning to Generate Unit Tests for Automated Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01619v3)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unit tests (UTs) play an instrumental role in assessing code correctness as well as providing feedback to large language models (LLMs), motivating automated test generation. However, we uncover a trade-off between generating unit test inputs that reveal errors when given a faulty code and correctly predicting the unit test output without access to the gold solution. To address this trade-off, we propose UTGen, which teaches LLMs to generate unit test inputs that reveal errors along with their correct expected outputs based on task descriptions. Since model-generated tests can provide noisy signals (e.g., from incorrectly predicted outputs), we propose UTDebug that (i) scales UTGen via test-time compute to improve UT output prediction, and (ii) validates and backtracks edits based on multiple generated UTs to avoid overfitting, and helps LLMs debug effectively. We show that UTGen outperforms other LLM-based baselines by 7.59% based on a metric measuring the presence of both error-revealing UT inputs and correct UT outputs. When used with UTDebug, we find that feedback from UTGen's unit tests improves pass@1 accuracy of Qwen2.5 32B on HumanEvalFix and our own harder debugging split of MBPP+ by over 3.17% and 12.35% (respectively) over other LLM-based UT generation baselines. Moreover, we observe that feedback from Qwen2.5 32B-based UTGen model can enhance debugging with frontier LLMs like GPT-4o by 13.8%. Lastly, we demonstrate that UTGen is a better judge for code correctness, outperforming a state-of-the-art trained 8B reward model by 4.43% on HumanEval+ with best-of-10 sampling using Qwen2.5 7B.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLM 2025.

Hooks are a set of APIs that manage side effects in function components in React. However, their semantics are often seen as opaque to developers, leading to UI bugs. We introduce React-tRace, a formalization of the semantics of the essence of React Hooks, providing a semantics that clarifies their behavior. We demonstrate that our model captures the behavior of React, by theoretically showing that it embodies essential properties of Hooks and empirically comparing our React-tRace-definitional interpreter against a test suite. Furthermore, we showcase a practical visualization tool based on the formalization to demonstrate how developers can better understand the semantics of Hooks.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in OOPSLA2 2025</p></details> |

To cope with these incidents, it is important to timely detect their occurrences, localize the sources of the problems, and implement the appropriate countermeasures. This paper reports our experience with a state-of-the-art failure prediction method, PREVENT, and its extension with a troubleshooting module, REACT, applied to naval systems developed by Fincantieri. Our results show how to integrate anomaly detection with troubleshooting procedures. We conclude by discussing a lesson learned, which may help deploy and extend these analyses to other industrial products.</p></details> |  |

Technical debt (TD) items are constructs in a software system providing short-term benefits but hindering future changes. TD management (TDM) is frequently researched but rarely adopted in practice. Goal. This study aimed to establish a TDM process in an IT company based on a predefined workshop concept. We analyzed which research approaches practitioners adopted for each TD activity and the TDM's long-term effect on TD awareness. Method. We used action research (five action cycles in 16 months) with an IT team that creates IT solutions for signal processing. To examine TD awareness, we (1) analyzed questionnaires completed during each workshop, (2) observed team meetings, (3) adopted a method from psychology for measuring awareness in decision-making situations called TD-SAGAT, and (4) evaluated the backlog data. Results. Practitioners preferred TD repayment and prioritization based on the system's evolution and cost calculations, i.e., repayment of so-called low-hanging fruits. Reminders in the backlog items, such as checkboxes or text templates, led to a sustainable rise in TD awareness. Conclusions. We showed that a workshop-based approach is feasible and leads to sustainable process changes. New ideas for TDM applicable to other IT teams emerged, e.g., using a re-submission date, using a Talked about TD checkbox, and using visualizations for TD prioritization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication by the Journal of Systems and Software -- Special Issue on Managing Technical Debt in Software-Intensive Products and Services</p></details> |

HEAS represents models as hierarchies of lightweight processes ("streams") scheduled in deterministic layers that read and write a shared context, making cross-scale couplings explicit and auditable. A compact API and CLI-simulate, optimize, evaluate-expose single- and multi-objective evolution, PyTorch policy integration via parameter flattening/unflattening, and general tournament tooling with user-defined scoring and voting rules. The framework standardizes evaluation through uniform per-step and episode metrics, persists seeds, logbooks, and hall-of-fame archives, and provides plotting helpers for traces, Pareto fronts, and comparative outcomes, reducing glue code and improving comparability across studies. HEAS emphasizes separation of mechanism from orchestration, allowing exogenous drivers, endogenous agents, and aggregators to be composed and swapped without refactoring, while the same model can be used for forward simulation, optimization, or systematic comparison. We illustrate usage with two compact examples-an ecological system and an enterprise decision-making setting. HEAS offers a practical foundation for cross-disciplinary, multi-level inquiry, yielding reliable, reproducible results.</p></details> | 9 pages, 1 figure |
| **[A Novel Mutation Based Method for Detecting FPGA Logic Synthesis Tool Bugs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15536v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) logic synthesis tools are key components in the EDA (Electronic Design Automation) toolchain. They convert hardware designs written in description languages such as Verilog into gate-level representations for FPGAs. However, defects in these tools may lead to unexpected behaviors and pose security risks. Therefore, it is crucial to harden these tools through testing. Although several methods have been proposed to automatically test FPGA logic synthesis tools, the challenge remains of insufficient semantic and logical complexity in test programs. In this paper, we propose VERMEI, a new method for testing FPGA logic synthesis tools. VERMEI consists of three modules: preprocessing, equivalent mutation, and bug identification. The preprocessing module identifies zombie logic (inactive code with no impact on the circuit output) in seed programs through simulation and coverage analysis. The equivalent mutation module generates equivalent variants of seed programs by pruning or inserting logic fragments in zombie areas. It uses Bayesian sampling to extract logic fragments from historical Verilog designs, making the generated variants have complex control flows and structures. The bug identification module, based on differential testing, compares the synthesized outputs of seed and variant programs to identify bugs. Experiments on Yosys, Vivado, and Quartus demonstrate that VERMEI outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Within five months, VERMEI reported 15 bugs to vendors, 9 of which were confirmed as new.</p></details> |  |

Unfortunately, many studies show that maintainability often receives less attention than its importance warrants. We argue that requirements engineering can address this gap the problem by fostering discussions and setting appropriate targets in a responsible manner. In this preliminary work, we conducted an exploratory study of industry practices related to requirements engineering for maintainability. Our findings confirm previous studies: maintainability remains a second-class quality concern. Explicit requirements often make sweeping references to coding conventions. Tools providing maintainability proxies are common but typically only used in implicit requirements related to engineering practices. To address this, we propose QUPER-MAn, a maintainability adaption of the QUPER model, which was originally developed to help organizations set targets for performance requirements. Developed using a design science approach, QUPER-MAn, integrates maintainability benchmarks and supports target setting. We posit that it can shift maintainability from an overlooked development consequence to an actively managed goal driven by informed and responsible engineering decisions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 1st International Workshop on Responsible Software Engineering</p></details> |

We present a community effort to scope this space, introducing a taxonomy of LLM-based study types together with eight guidelines for designing and reporting empirical studies involving LLMs. The guidelines present essential (must) criteria as well as desired (should) criteria and target transparency throughout the research process. Our recommendations, contextualized by our study types, are: (1) to declare LLM usage and role; (2) to report model versions, configurations, and fine-tuning; (3) to document tool architectures; (4) to disclose prompts and interaction logs; (5) to use human validation; (6) to employ an open LLM as a baseline; (7) to report suitable baselines, benchmarks, and metrics; and (8) to openly articulate limitations and mitigations. Our goal is to enable reproducibility and replicability despite LLM-specific barriers to open science. We maintain the study types and guidelines online as a living resource for the community to use and shape (llm-guidelines.org).</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft of evaluation guidelines for empirical studies in software engineering involving LLMs (see also llm-guidelines.org)</p></details> |

The emerging automated quality assessment techniques targeting chatbots often rely on limited pools of subjects, such as custom-made toy examples, or outdated, no longer available, or scarcely popular agents, complicating the evaluation of such techniques. In this paper, we present two datasets and the tool support necessary to create and maintain these datasets. The first dataset is RASA TASK-BASED CHATBOTS FROM GITHUB (TOFU-R), which is a snapshot of the Rasa chatbots available on GitHub, representing the state of the practice in open-source chatbot development with Rasa.

Due to the near real-time response requirements of this task, base models with small to medium-sized parameters are typically employed, supplemented by various optimization and post-training techniques. However, these optimization methods often have trade-offs, leading to a seesaw effect where performance improvements on certain datasets or metrics are accompanied by degradations on others -- sometimes even falling below the baseline model's performance. This paper proposes SynthCoder, a model that integrates leading industry practices to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) code completion task. In specific, we first construct a diverse dataset by combining Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) node extraction with heuristics that simulate developer behavior. Then we enrich our training corpus with cross-file contextual information using the BM25 algorithm and call graphs, enhancing the model's ability to perform code completion in both file-level and repository-level scenarios. As the last step, we employ a two-stage training process using the Seed-Coder-8B-Base as the base model. First, we fine-tune the model using Curriculum Learning technology. Following this, we perform alignment using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with preference pairs generated through Rejection Sampling. Experimental results demonstrate that our final model excels on mainstream repository-level code completion benchmarks, including aiXcoder, ExecRepoBench, CrossCodeEval, and CoLT. Furthermore, our carefully curated training set effectively mitigates the model's tendency to just repeat existing code, a common issue existing in various code completion models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Innamark: A Whitespace Replacement Information-Hiding Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12710v3)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant popularity in recent years. Differentiating between a text written by a human and one generated by an LLM has become almost impossible. Information-hiding techniques such as digital watermarking or steganography can help by embedding information inside text in a form that is unlikely to be noticed. However, existing techniques, such as linguistic-based or format-based methods, change the semantics or cannot be applied to pure, unformatted text. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for information hiding called Innamark, which can conceal any byte-encoded sequence within a sufficiently long cover text. This method is implemented as a multi-platform library using the Kotlin programming language, which is accompanied by a command-line tool and a web interface. By substituting conventional whitespace characters with visually similar Unicode whitespace characters, our proposed scheme preserves the semantics of the cover text without changing the number of characters. Furthermore, we propose a specified structure for secret messages that enables configurable compression, encryption, hashing, and error correction. An experimental benchmark comparison on a dataset of 1 000 000 Wikipedia articles compares ten algorithms. The results demonstrate the robustness of our proposed Innamark method in various applications and the imperceptibility of its watermarks to humans. We discuss the limits to the embedding capacity and robustness of the algorithm and how these could be addressed in future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and published in the IEEE Access journal as extended version of doi:10.24251/HICSS.2025.886</p></details> |

However, LLMs are prone to hallucination-outputs that stray from intended meanings. Detecting hallucinations in code summarization is especially difficult due to the complex interplay between programming and natural languages. We introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset with $\sim$10K samples, curated specifically for hallucination detection in code summarization. We further propose a novel Entity Tracing Framework (ETF) that a) utilizes static program analysis to identify code entities from the program and b) uses LLMs to map and verify these entities and their intents within generated code summaries. Our experimental analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the framework, leading to a 0.73 F1 score. This approach provides an interpretable method for detecting hallucinations by grounding entities, allowing us to evaluate summary accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |

However, efforts to quantify and track this progress have suffered due to a lack of reliable metrics for functional correctness. While popular benchmarks like HumanEval have test cases to enable reliable evaluation of correctness, it is time-consuming and requires human effort to collect test cases. As an alternative several reference-based evaluation metrics have been proposed, with embedding-based metrics like CodeBERTScore being touted as having a high correlation with human preferences and functional correctness. In our work, we analyze the ability of embedding-based metrics like CodeBERTScore to measure functional correctness and other helpful constructs like editing effort by analyzing outputs of ten models over two popular code generation benchmarks. Our results show that while they have a weak correlation with functional correctness (0.16), they are strongly correlated (0.72) with editing effort.</p></details> |  |

Thanks to the rapid development of pre-training techniques, surging large language models are being proposed for code, sparking the advances in NL2Code. To facilitate further research and applications in this field, in this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of 27 existing large language models for NL2Code, and also review benchmarks and metrics. We provide an intuitive comparison of all existing models on the HumanEval benchmark. Through in-depth observation and analysis, we provide some insights and conclude that the key factors contributing to the success of large language models for NL2Code are "Large Size, Premium Data, Expert Tuning". In addition, we discuss challenges and opportunities regarding the gap between models and humans. We also create a website https://nl2code.github.io to track the latest progress through crowd-sourcing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey of large language models for NL2Code, and we believe it will contribute to the ongoing development of the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the main conference of ACL 2023 (long paper)</p></details> |

GPS treats the task of model checking a program as a directed search of the program states, guided by a compositional, summary-based static analysis. The summaries produced by static analysis are used both to prune away infeasible paths and to drive test generation to reach new, unexplored program states. GPS can find both proofs of safety and counter-examples to safety (i.e., inputs that trigger bugs), and features a novel two-layered search strategy that renders it particularly efficient at finding bugs in programs featuring long, input-dependent error paths. To make GPS refutationally complete (in the sense that it will find an error if one exists, if it is allotted enough time), we introduce an instrumentation technique and show that it helps GPS achieve refutation-completeness without sacrificing overall performance. We benchmarked GPS on a suite of benchmarks including both programs from the Software Verification Competition (SV-COMP) and from prior literature, and found that our implementation of GPS outperforms state-of-the-art software model checkers (including the top performers in SV-COMP ReachSafety-Loops category), both in terms of the number of benchmarks solved and in terms of running time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of paper in OOPSLA 2025 (with updated evaluations section compared to v1 manuscript). 37 pages</p></details> |

Still in its infancy, large language model (LLM)-based proof generation lags behind LLM-based code generation. In this paper, we present AutoVerus. AutoVerus uses LLMs to automatically generate correctness proof for Rust code. AutoVerus is designed to match the unique features of Verus, a verification tool that can prove the correctness of Rust code using proofs and specifications also written in Rust. AutoVerus consists of a network of LLM agents that are crafted and orchestrated to mimic human experts' three phases of proof construction: preliminary proof generation, proof refinement guided by generic tips, and proof debugging guided by verification errors. To thoroughly evaluate AutoVerus and help foster future research in this direction, we have built a benchmark suite of 150 non-trivial proof tasks, based on existing code-generation benchmarks and verification benchmarks. Our evaluation shows that AutoVerus can automatically generate correct proof for more than 90% of them, with more than half of them tackled in less than 30 seconds or 3 LLM calls.</p></details> | OOPSLA 2025 |
| **[Using LLMs and Essence to Support Software Practice Adoption](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16445v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP) have enabled the development of automated tools that support various domains, including software engineering. However, while NLP and artificial intelligence (AI) research has extensively focused on tasks such as code generation, less attention has been given to automating support for the adoption of best practices, the evolution of ways of working, and the monitoring of process health. This study addresses this gap by exploring the integration of Essence, a standard and thinking framework for managing software engineering practices, with large language models (LLMs). To this end, a specialised chatbot was developed to assist students and professionals in understanding and applying Essence. The chatbot employs a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system to retrieve relevant contextual information from a curated knowledge base. Four different LLMs were used to create multiple chatbot configurations, each evaluated both as a base model and augmented with the RAG system. The system performance was evaluated through both the relevance of retrieved context and the quality of generated responses. Comparative analysis against the general-purpose LLMs demonstrated that the proposed system consistently outperforms its baseline counterpart in domain-specific tasks. By facilitating access to structured software engineering knowledge, this work contributes to bridging the gap between theoretical frameworks and practical application, potentially improving process management and the adoption of software development practices. While further validation through user studies is required, these findings highlight the potential of LLM-based automation to enhance learning and decision-making in software engineering.</p></details> |  |

Yet, their real-world effectiveness in detecting diverse software bugs, particularly complex, security-relevant vulnerabilities, remains underexplored. This study presents a systematic, empirical evaluation of these three leading LLMs using a benchmark of foundational programming errors, classic security flaws, and advanced, production-grade bugs in C++ and Python. The dataset integrates real code from SEED Labs, OpenSSL (via the Suresoft GLaDOS database), and PyBugHive, validated through local compilation and testing pipelines. A novel multi-stage, context-aware prompting protocol simulates realistic debugging scenarios, while a graded rubric measures detection accuracy, reasoning depth, and remediation quality. Our results show that all models excel at identifying syntactic and semantic issues in well-scoped code, making them promising for educational use and as first-pass reviewers in automated code auditing. Performance diminishes in scenarios involving complex security vulnerabilities and large-scale production code, with ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3 generally providing more nuanced contextual analyses than LLaMA 4. This highlights both the promise and the present constraints of LLMs in serving as reliable code analysis tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[AetherCode: Evaluating LLMs' Ability to Win In Premier Programming Competitions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16402v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Competitive programming has emerged as a critical benchmark for evaluating the reasoning and coding capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite impressive progress on existing benchmarks, we argue that current evaluations overstate model proficiency, masking a substantial gap between LLMs and elite human programmers. This gap arises from two key limitations: insufficient difficulty and scope of benchmark problems, and evaluation bias from low-quality test cases. To address these shortcomings, we present AetherCode, a new benchmark that draws problems from premier programming competitions such as IOI and ICPC, offering broader coverage and higher difficulty. AetherCode further incorporates comprehensive, expert-validated test suites built through a hybrid of automated generation and human curation, ensuring rigorous and reliable assessment. By combining challenging problem design with robust evaluation, AetherCode provides a more faithful measure of LLM capabilities and sets a new standard for future research in code reasoning.</p></details> | 15 pages |

Despite the popularity of MSA in the software industry, there is a limited evidence-based and thorough understanding of the types of issues (e.g., errors, faults, failures, and bugs) that microservices system developers experience, the causes of the issues, and the solutions as potential fixing strategies to address the issues. To ameliorate this gap, we conducted a mixed-methods empirical study that collected data from 2,641 issues from the issue tracking systems of 15 open-source microservices systems on GitHub, 15 interviews, and an online survey completed by 150 practitioners from 42 countries across 6 continents. Our analysis led to comprehensive taxonomies for the issues, causes, and solutions. The findings of this study informthat Technical Debt, Continuous Integration and Delivery, Exception Handling, Service Execution and Communication, and Security are the most dominant issues in microservices systems. Furthermore, General Programming Errors, Missing Features and Artifacts, and Invalid Configuration and Communication are the main causes behind the issues. Finally, we found 177 types of solutions that can be applied to fix the identified issues. Based on our study results, we formulated future research directions that could help researchers and practitioners to engineer emergent and next-generation microservices systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 5 images, 7 tables, Manuscript submitted to a Journal (2025)</p></details> |

While tools like EvoSuite focus on maximizing code coverage, recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shifted attention toward LLM-based test generation. However, code coverage metrics -- such as line and branch coverage -- remain overly emphasized in reported research, despite being weak indicators of a test suite's fault-detection capability. In contrast, mutation score offers a more reliable and stringent measure, as demonstrated in our findings where some test suites achieve 100% coverage but only 4% mutation score. Although a few studies consider mutation score, the effectiveness of LLMs in killing mutants remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose MUTGEN, a mutation-guided, LLM-based test generation approach that incorporates mutation feedback directly into the prompt. Evaluated on 204 subjects from two benchmarks, MUTGEN significantly outperforms both EvoSuite and vanilla prompt-based strategies in terms of mutation score. Furthermore, MUTGEN introduces an iterative generation mechanism that pushes the limits of LLMs in killing additional mutants. Our study also provide insights into the limitations of LLM-based generation, analyzing the reasons for live and uncovered mutants, and the impact of different mutation operators on generation effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Metamorphic Coverage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16307v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metamorphic testing is a widely used methodology that examines an expected relation between pairs of executions to automatically find bugs, such as correctness bugs. We found that code coverage cannot accurately measure the extent to which code is validated and mutation testing is computationally expensive for evaluating metamorphic testing methods. In this work, we propose Metamorphic Coverage (MC), a coverage metric that examines the distinct code executed by pairs of test inputs within metamorphic testing. Our intuition is that, typically, a bug can be observed if the corresponding code is executed when executing either test input but not the other one, so covering more differential code covered by pairs of test inputs might be more likely to expose bugs. While most metamorphic testing methods have been based on this general intuition, our work defines and systematically evaluates MC on five widely used metamorphic testing methods for testing database engines, compilers, and constraint solvers. The code measured by MC overlaps with the bug-fix locations of 50 of 64 bugs found by metamorphic testing methods, and MC has a stronger positive correlation with bug numbers than line coverage. MC is 4x more sensitive than line coverage in distinguishing testing methods' effectiveness, and the average value of MC is 6x smaller than line coverage while still capturing the part of the program that is being tested. MC required 359x less time than mutation testing. Based on a case study for an automated database system testing approach, we demonstrate that when used for feedback guidance, MC significantly outperforms code coverage, by finding 41\% more bugs. Consequently, this work might have broad applications for assessing metamorphic testing methods and improving test-case generation.</p></details> |  |

This challenge is amplified when targeting newer or less-documented GPU architectures where traditional development aids are scarce. This paper introduces an LLM-powered "GPU Kernel Scientist," an automated methodology for iteratively refining accelerator kernels. Our methodology employs LLMs in a multi-stage, evolutionary process: (a) strategically selecting promising prior code versions as a basis for new iterations; (b) generating hypotheses for optimization experiments, based on existing code and assimilated knowledge from general GPU literature; and (c) autonomously implementing these experiments through code modification and subsequent submission to an external evaluation system, using only observed timing data as performance feedback. We detail how this approach navigates the challenges of the AMD MI300 target architecture and leverages LLMs to compensate for limited domain-specific human expertise. In addition to our results, we present the architectural design, operational workflow, and qualitative insights, highlighting the potential of LLM-driven agents to democratise and accelerate GPU kernel optimization, especially in resource-constrained or rapidly updating hardware environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>4+1 p...</summary><p>4+1 page paper plus Appendices and Supplementary zip file.

It can boost developer productivity while providing a powerful code discovery tool. Following the Large Language Model (LLM) wave, code completion has been approached with diverse LLMs fine-tuned on code (code LLMs). The performance of code LLMs can be assessed with downstream and intrinsic metrics. Downstream metrics are usually employed to evaluate the practical utility of a model, but can be unreliable and require complex calculations and domain-specific knowledge. In contrast, intrinsic metrics such as perplexity, entropy, and mutual information, which measure model confidence or uncertainty, are simple, versatile, and universal across LLMs and tasks, and can serve as proxies for functional correctness and hallucination risk in LLM-generated code. Motivated by this, we evaluate the confidence of LLMs when generating code by measuring code perplexity across programming languages, models, and datasets using various LLMs, and a sample of 1008 files from 657 GitHub projects. We find that strongly-typed languages exhibit lower perplexity than dynamically typed languages. Scripting languages also demonstrate higher perplexity. Perl appears universally high in perplexity, whereas Java appears low. Code perplexity depends on the employed LLM, but not on the code dataset. Although code comments often increase perplexity, the language ranking based on perplexity is barely affected by their presence. LLM researchers, developers, and users can employ our findings to assess the benefits and suitability of LLM-based code completion in specific software projects based on how language, model choice, and code characteristics impact model confidence.</p></details> | 30 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Leveraging Large Language Models to Detect Missed Peephole Optimizations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16125v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By replacing small, suboptimal instruction sequences within programs with a more efficient equivalent, peephole optimization can not only directly optimize code size and performance, but also potentially enables further transformations in the subsequent optimization pipeline. Although peephole optimization is a critical class of compiler optimizations, discovering new and effective peephole optimizations is challenging as the instruction sets can be extremely complex and diverse. Previous methods either do not scale well or can only capture a limited subset of peephole optimizations. In this work, we leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect missed peephole optimizations. We propose Lampo, a novel automated framework that synergistically combines the creative but unreliable code optimization ability of LLMs with rigorous correctness verification performed by translation validation tools, integrated in a feedback-driven iterative process. Through a comprehensive evaluation within LLVM ecosystems, we show that Lampo can successfully detect up to 17 out of 25 previously reported missed optimizations in LLVM on average, and that 22 out of 25 can potentially be found by Lampo with different LLMs. For comparison, the state-of-the-art superoptimizer for LLVM, Souper, identified 15 of them. Moreover, within seven months of development and intermittent experiments, Lampo found 26 missed peephole optimizations, 15 of which have been confirmed and 6 already fixed. These results demonstrate Lampo's strong potential in continuously detecting missed peephole optimizations.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Benchmark Data To Applicable Program Repair: An Experience Report](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16071v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper describes our approach to automated program repair. We combine various techniques from the literature to achieve this. Our experiments show that our approach performs better than other techniques on standard benchmarks. However, on closer inspection, none of these techniques work on realistic defects that we see in industry. We find that augmenting code with formal specifications enables LLMs to generate higher-quality unit tests, especially for complex production code with improved coverage of edge cases and exception handling. However, specifications add little value for well-understood errors (e.g., null pointer, index out of bounds), but are beneficial for logic and string manipulation errors. Despite encouraging benchmark results, real-world adoption is limited since passing tests do not guarantee correct patches. Current challenges include insufficient expressiveness of the JML specification language, necessitating advanced verification tools and richer predicates. Our ongoing work is exploring contract automata, programming by example, and testcase repair, with a focus on integrating human feedback and measuring productivity gains - highlighting the gap between academic benchmarks and practical industry needs</p></details> |  |
| **[Measuring the effectiveness of code review comments in GitHub repositories: A machine learning approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16053v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper illustrates an empirical study of the working efficiency of machine learning techniques in classifying code review text by semantic meaning. The code review comments from the source control repository in GitHub were extracted for development activity from the existing year for three open-source projects. Apart from that, programmers need to be aware of their code and point out their errors. In that case, it is a must to classify the sentiment polarity of the code review comments to avoid an error. We manually labelled 13557 code review comments generated by three open source projects in GitHub during the existing year. In order to recognize the sentiment polarity (or sentiment orientation) of code reviews, we use seven machine learning algorithms and compare those results to find the better ones. Among those Linear Support Vector Classifier(SVC) classifier technique achieves higher accuracy than others. This study will help programmers to make any solution based on code reviews by avoiding misconceptions.</p></details> |  |

Current methods on PCR mainly focus on the reviewer's perspective, including finding a capable reviewer, predicting comment quality, and recommending/generating review comments. However, it is not well studied that how to satisfy the review necessity requests posted by developers which can increase their visibility, which in turn acts as a prerequisite for better review responses. To this end, we propose K nowledge-guided P rompt learning for P ublic Code Review (KP-PCR) to achieve developer-based code review request quality assurance (i.e., predicting request necessity and recommending tags subtask). Specifically, we reformulate the two subtasks via 1) text prompt tuning which converts both of them into a Masked Language Model (MLM) by constructing prompt templates using hard prompt; and 2) knowledge and code prefix tuning which introduces knowledge guidance from fine-tuned large language models by soft prompt, and uses program dependence graph to characterize code snippets. Finally, both of the request necessity prediction and tag recommendation subtasks output predicted results through an answer engineering module. In addition, we further analysis the time complexity of our KP-PCR that has lightweight prefix based the operation of introducing knowledge guidance. Experimental results on the PCR dataset for the period 2011-2023 demonstrate that our KP-PCR outperforms baselines by 2.3%-8.4% in the request necessity prediction and by 1.4%-6.9% in the tag recommendation. The code implementation is released at https://github.com/WUT-IDEA/KP-PCR.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 5 images, 12 tables, Manuscript revision submitted to a journal (2025)</p></details> |
| **[Learning to Generate Unit Tests for Automated Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01619v3)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unit tests (UTs) play an instrumental role in assessing code correctness as well as providing feedback to large language models (LLMs), motivating automated test generation. However, we uncover a trade-off between generating unit test inputs that reveal errors when given a faulty code and correctly predicting the unit test output without access to the gold solution. To address this trade-off, we propose UTGen, which teaches LLMs to generate unit test inputs that reveal errors along with their correct expected outputs based on task descriptions. Since model-generated tests can provide noisy signals (e.g., from incorrectly predicted outputs), we propose UTDebug that (i) scales UTGen via test-time compute to improve UT output prediction, and (ii) validates and backtracks edits based on multiple generated UTs to avoid overfitting, and helps LLMs debug effectively. We show that UTGen outperforms other LLM-based baselines by 7.59% based on a metric measuring the presence of both error-revealing UT inputs and correct UT outputs. When used with UTDebug, we find that feedback from UTGen's unit tests improves pass@1 accuracy of Qwen2.5 32B on HumanEvalFix and our own harder debugging split of MBPP+ by over 3.17% and 12.35% (respectively) over other LLM-based UT generation baselines. Moreover, we observe that feedback from Qwen2.5 32B-based UTGen model can enhance debugging with frontier LLMs like GPT-4o by 13.8%. Lastly, we demonstrate that UTGen is a better judge for code correctness, outperforming a state-of-the-art trained 8B reward model by 4.43% on HumanEval+ with best-of-10 sampling using Qwen2.5 7B.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to COLM 2025.

Technical debt (TD) items are constructs in a software system providing short-term benefits but hindering future changes. TD management (TDM) is frequently researched but rarely adopted in practice. Goal. This study aimed to establish a TDM process in an IT company based on a predefined workshop concept. We analyzed which research approaches practitioners adopted for each TD activity and the TDM's long-term effect on TD awareness. Method. We used action research (five action cycles in 16 months) with an IT team that creates IT solutions for signal processing. To examine TD awareness, we (1) analyzed questionnaires completed during each workshop, (2) observed team meetings, (3) adopted a method from psychology for measuring awareness in decision-making situations called TD-SAGAT, and (4) evaluated the backlog data. Results. Practitioners preferred TD repayment and prioritization based on the system's evolution and cost calculations, i.e., repayment of so-called low-hanging fruits. Reminders in the backlog items, such as checkboxes or text templates, led to a sustainable rise in TD awareness. Conclusions. We showed that a workshop-based approach is feasible and leads to sustainable process changes. New ideas for TDM applicable to other IT teams emerged, e.g., using a re-submission date, using a Talked about TD checkbox, and using visualizations for TD prioritization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication by the Journal of Systems and Software -- Special Issue on Managing Technical Debt in Software-Intensive Products and Services</p></details> |
| **[HEAS: Hierarchical Evolutionary Agent Simulation Framework for Cross-Scale Modeling and Multi-Objective Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15555v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hierarchical Evolutionary Agent Simulation (HEAS) is a Python framework that unifies layered agent-based modeling with evolutionary optimization and tournament evaluation in a single, reproducible workflow. HEAS represents models as hierarchies of lightweight processes ("streams") scheduled in deterministic layers that read and write a shared context, making cross-scale couplings explicit and auditable. A compact API and CLI-simulate, optimize, evaluate-expose single- and multi-objective evolution, PyTorch policy integration via parameter flattening/unflattening, and general tournament tooling with user-defined scoring and voting rules. The framework standardizes evaluation through uniform per-step and episode metrics, persists seeds, logbooks, and hall-of-fame archives, and provides plotting helpers for traces, Pareto fronts, and comparative outcomes, reducing glue code and improving comparability across studies. HEAS emphasizes separation of mechanism from orchestration, allowing exogenous drivers, endogenous agents, and aggregators to be composed and swapped without refactoring, while the same model can be used for forward simulation, optimization, or systematic comparison. We illustrate usage with two compact examples-an ecological system and an enterprise decision-making setting. HEAS offers a practical foundation for cross-disciplinary, multi-level inquiry, yielding reliable, reproducible results.</p></details> | 9 pages, 1 figure |
| **[A Novel Mutation Based Method for Detecting FPGA Logic Synthesis Tool Bugs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15536v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) logic synthesis tools are key components in the EDA (Electronic Design Automation) toolchain. They convert hardware designs written in description languages such as Verilog into gate-level representations for FPGAs. However, defects in these tools may lead to unexpected behaviors and pose security risks. Therefore, it is crucial to harden these tools through testing. Although several methods have been proposed to automatically test FPGA logic synthesis tools, the challenge remains of insufficient semantic and logical complexity in test programs. In this paper, we propose VERMEI, a new method for testing FPGA logic synthesis tools. VERMEI consists of three modules: preprocessing, equivalent mutation, and bug identification. The preprocessing module identifies zombie logic (inactive code with no impact on the circuit output) in seed programs through simulation and coverage analysis. The equivalent mutation module generates equivalent variants of seed programs by pruning or inserting logic fragments in zombie areas. It uses Bayesian sampling to extract logic fragments from historical Verilog designs, making the generated variants have complex control flows and structures. The bug identification module, based on differential testing, compares the synthesized outputs of seed and variant programs to identify bugs. Experiments on Yosys, Vivado, and Quartus demonstrate that VERMEI outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Within five months, VERMEI reported 15 bugs to vendors, 9 of which were confirmed as new.</p></details> |  |

Unfortunately, many studies show that maintainability often receives less attention than its importance warrants. We argue that requirements engineering can address this gap the problem by fostering discussions and setting appropriate targets in a responsible manner. In this preliminary work, we conducted an exploratory study of industry practices related to requirements engineering for maintainability. Our findings confirm previous studies: maintainability remains a second-class quality concern. Explicit requirements often make sweeping references to coding conventions. Tools providing maintainability proxies are common but typically only used in implicit requirements related to engineering practices. To address this, we propose QUPER-MAn, a maintainability adaption of the QUPER model, which was originally developed to help organizations set targets for performance requirements. Developed using a design science approach, QUPER-MAn, integrates maintainability benchmarks and supports target setting. We posit that it can shift maintainability from an overlooked development consequence to an actively managed goal driven by informed and responsible engineering decisions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 1st International Workshop on Responsible Software Engineering</p></details> |

Due to the near real-time response requirements of this task, base models with small to medium-sized parameters are typically employed, supplemented by various optimization and post-training techniques. However, these optimization methods often have trade-offs, leading to a seesaw effect where performance improvements on certain datasets or metrics are accompanied by degradations on others -- sometimes even falling below the baseline model's performance. This paper proposes SynthCoder, a model that integrates leading industry practices to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) code completion task. In specific, we first construct a diverse dataset by combining Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) node extraction with heuristics that simulate developer behavior. Then we enrich our training corpus with cross-file contextual information using the BM25 algorithm and call graphs, enhancing the model's ability to perform code completion in both file-level and repository-level scenarios. As the last step, we employ a two-stage training process using the Seed-Coder-8B-Base as the base model. First, we fine-tune the model using Curriculum Learning technology. Following this, we perform alignment using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with preference pairs generated through Rejection Sampling. Experimental results demonstrate that our final model excels on mainstream repository-level code completion benchmarks, including aiXcoder, ExecRepoBench, CrossCodeEval, and CoLT. Furthermore, our carefully curated training set effectively mitigates the model's tendency to just repeat existing code, a common issue existing in various code completion models.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Study of Knowledge Distillation for Code Understanding Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15423v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for code understanding. However, deploying these PLMs in large-scale applications faces practical challenges due to their computational intensity and inference latency. Knowledge distillation (KD), a promising model compression and acceleration technique, addresses these limitations by transferring knowledge from large teacher models to compact student models, enabling efficient inference while preserving most of the teacher models' capabilities. While this technique has shown remarkable success in natural language processing and computer vision domains, its potential for code understanding tasks remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we systematically investigate the effectiveness and usage of KD in code understanding tasks. Our study encompasses two popular types of KD methods, i.e., logit-based and feature-based KD methods, experimenting across eight student models and two teacher PLMs from different domains on three downstream tasks. The experimental results indicate that KD consistently offers notable performance boosts across student models with different sizes compared with standard fine-tuning. Notably, code-specific PLM demonstrates better effectiveness as the teacher model. Among all KD methods, the latest feature-based KD methods exhibit superior performance, enabling student models to retain up to 98% teacher performance with merely 5% parameters. Regarding student architecture, our experiments reveal that similarity with teacher architecture does not necessarily lead to better performance. We further discuss the efficiency and behaviors in the KD process and inference, summarize the implications of findings, and identify promising future directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICSE 2026 (Cycle 1)</p></details> |

Beyond the sheer number of subsystems involved, the difficulty stems from their diversity and interaction depth. In this paper, we use a compact heterogeneous robotic system (HeROS), combining mobile and manipulation capabilities, as a demonstration vehicle under dynamically changing tasks. Notably, all its subsystems are powered by ROS. The use of compatible interfaces and other ROS integration capabilities simplifies the construction of such systems. However, this only addresses part of the complexity: the semantic coherence and structural traceability are even more important for precise coordination and call for deliberate engineering methods. The Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) discipline, which emerged from the experience of complexity management in large-scale engineering domains, offers the methodological foundations needed. Despite their strengths in complementary aspects of robotics systems engineering, the lack of a unified approach to integrate ROS and MBSE hinders the full potential of these tools. Motivated by the anticipated impact of such a synergy in robotics practice, we propose a structured methodology based on MeROS - a SysML metamodel created specifically to put the ROS-based systems into the focus of the MBSE workflow. As its methodological backbone, we adapt the well-known V-model to this context, illustrating how complex robotic systems can be designed with traceability and validation capabilities embedded into their lifecycle using practices familiar to engineering teams.</p></details> | 22 pages |

GPS treats the task of model checking a program as a directed search of the program states, guided by a compositional, summary-based static analysis. The summaries produced by static analysis are used both to prune away infeasible paths and to drive test generation to reach new, unexplored program states. GPS can find both proofs of safety and counter-examples to safety (i.e., inputs that trigger bugs), and features a novel two-layered search strategy that renders it particularly efficient at finding bugs in programs featuring long, input-dependent error paths. To make GPS refutationally complete (in the sense that it will find an error if one exists, if it is allotted enough time), we introduce an instrumentation technique and show that it helps GPS achieve refutation-completeness without sacrificing overall performance. We benchmarked GPS on a suite of benchmarks including both programs from the Software Verification Competition (SV-COMP) and from prior literature, and found that our implementation of GPS outperforms state-of-the-art software model checkers (including the top performers in SV-COMP ReachSafety-Loops category), both in terms of the number of benchmarks solved and in terms of running time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of paper in OOPSLA 2025 (with updated evaluations section compared to v1 manuscript). 37 pages</p></details> |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in mitigating this effort, existing LLM-based automated debugging methods underperform on industrial-scale modules. A major reason for this is bug signal dilution in long contexts, where a few bug-relevant tokens are overwhelmed by hundreds of unrelated lines, diffusing the model's attention. To address this issue, we introduce ARSP, a two-stage system that mitigates dilution via semantics-guided fragmentation. A Partition LLM splits a module into semantically tight fragments; a Repair LLM patches each fragment; edits are merged without altering unrelated logic. A synthetic data framework generates fragment-level training pairs spanning bug types, design styles, and scales to supervise both models. Experiments show that ARSP achieves 77.92% pass@1 and 83.88% pass@5, outperforming mainstream commercial LLMs including Claude-3.7 and SOTA automated Verilog debugging tools Strider and MEIC. Also, semantic partitioning improves pass@1 by 11.6% and pass@5 by 10.2% over whole-module debugging, validating the effectiveness of fragment-level scope reduction in LLM-based Verilog debugging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Abmax: A JAX-based Agent-based Modeling Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16508v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a principal approach for studying complex systems. By decomposing a system into simpler, interacting agents, agent-based modeling (ABM) allows researchers to observe the emergence of complex phenomena. High-performance array computing libraries like JAX can help scale such computational models to a large number of agents by using automatic vectorization and just-in-time (JIT) compilation. One of the caveats of using JAX to achieve such scaling is that the shapes of arrays used in the computational model should remain immutable throughout the simulation. In the context of agent-based modeling (ABM), this can pose constraints on certain agent manipulation operations that require flexible data structures. A subset of which is represented by the ability to update a dynamically selected number of agents by applying distinct changes to them during a simulation. To this effect, we introduce Abmax, an ABM framework based on JAX that implements multiple just-in-time (JIT) compilable algorithms to provide this functionality. On the canonical predation model benchmark, Abmax achieves runtime performance comparable to state-of-the-art implementations. Further, we show that this functionality can also be vectorized, making it possible to run many similar agent-based models in parallel. We also present two examples in the form of a traffic-flow model and a financial market model to show the use case of Abmax.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables, 2 algorithms</p></details> |

Empirical Evidence of Quantized Small Language Models for Automated Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16499v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved the accuracy of automated program repair (APR) methods. However, LLMs are constrained by high computational resource requirements. Aims: We focus on small language models (SLMs), which perform well even with limited computational resources compared to LLMs. We aim to evaluate whether SLMs can achieve competitive performance in APR tasks. Method: We conducted experiments on the QuixBugs benchmark to compare the bug-fixing accuracy of SLMs and LLMs. We also analyzed the impact of int8 quantization on APR performance. Results: The latest SLMs can fix bugs as accurately as--or even more accurately than--LLMs. Also, int8 quantization had minimal effect on APR accuracy while significantly reducing memory requirements. Conclusions: SLMs present a viable alternative to LLMs for APR, offering competitive accuracy with lower computational costs, and quantization can further enhance their efficiency without compromising effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

Still in its infancy, large language model (LLM)-based proof generation lags behind LLM-based code generation. In this paper, we present AutoVerus. AutoVerus uses LLMs to automatically generate correctness proof for Rust code. AutoVerus is designed to match the unique features of Verus, a verification tool that can prove the correctness of Rust code using proofs and specifications also written in Rust. AutoVerus consists of a network of LLM agents that are crafted and orchestrated to mimic human experts' three phases of proof construction: preliminary proof generation, proof refinement guided by generic tips, and proof debugging guided by verification errors. To thoroughly evaluate AutoVerus and help foster future research in this direction, we have built a benchmark suite of 150 non-trivial proof tasks, based on existing code-generation benchmarks and verification benchmarks. Our evaluation shows that AutoVerus can automatically generate correct proof for more than 90% of them, with more than half of them tackled in less than 30 seconds or 3 LLM calls.</p></details> | OOPSLA 2025 |
| **[Using LLMs and Essence to Support Software Practice Adoption](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16445v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP) have enabled the development of automated tools that support various domains, including software engineering. However, while NLP and artificial intelligence (AI) research has extensively focused on tasks such as code generation, less attention has been given to automating support for the adoption of best practices, the evolution of ways of working, and the monitoring of process health. This study addresses this gap by exploring the integration of Essence, a standard and thinking framework for managing software engineering practices, with large language models (LLMs). To this end, a specialised chatbot was developed to assist students and professionals in understanding and applying Essence. The chatbot employs a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system to retrieve relevant contextual information from a curated knowledge base. Four different LLMs were used to create multiple chatbot configurations, each evaluated both as a base model and augmented with the RAG system. The system performance was evaluated through both the relevance of retrieved context and the quality of generated responses. Comparative analysis against the general-purpose LLMs demonstrated that the proposed system consistently outperforms its baseline counterpart in domain-specific tasks. By facilitating access to structured software engineering knowledge, this work contributes to bridging the gap between theoretical frameworks and practical application, potentially improving process management and the adoption of software development practices. While further validation through user studies is required, these findings highlight the potential of LLM-based automation to enhance learning and decision-making in software engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Classification or Prompting: A Case Study on Legal Requirements Traceability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04916v4)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>New regulations are introduced to ensure software development aligns with ethical concerns and protects public safety. Showing compliance requires tracing requirements to legal provisions. Requirements traceability is a key task where engineers must analyze technical requirements against target artifacts, often within limited time. Manually analyzing complex systems with hundreds of requirements is infeasible. The legal dimension adds challenges that increase effort. In this paper, we investigate two automated solutions based on language models, including large ones (LLMs). The first solution, Kashif, is a classifier that leverages sentence transformers and semantic similarity. The second solution, RICE_LRT, prompts a recent generative LLM based on RICE, a prompt engineering framework. On a benchmark dataset, we empirically evaluate Kashif and compare it against five different baseline classifiers from the literature. Kashif can identify trace links with a recall of 67%, precision of 50%, and F2 score of 63%, outperforming the best baseline by a substantial margin of 41 percentage points (pp) in F2. However, on unseen, more complex requirements documents traced to the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), Kashif performs poorly, yielding an average recall of 15%, an average precision of 10%, and an average F2 score of 13.5%. On the same documents, however, our RICE solution yields an average recall of 84%, an average precision of 30%, and an average F2 score of 61%. RICE achieved a remarkable improvement of 47.5 pp over Kashif in terms of F2 score. Our results suggest that requirements traceability in the legal context cannot be simply addressed by building classifiers, as such solutions do not generalize and fail to perform well on complex regulations and requirements. Resorting to generative LLMs, with careful prompt engineering, is thus a more promising alternative.</p></details> | 38 pages, 4 figues |

Yet, their real-world effectiveness in detecting diverse software bugs, particularly complex, security-relevant vulnerabilities, remains underexplored. This study presents a systematic, empirical evaluation of these three leading LLMs using a benchmark of foundational programming errors, classic security flaws, and advanced, production-grade bugs in C++ and Python. The dataset integrates real code from SEED Labs, OpenSSL (via the Suresoft GLaDOS database), and PyBugHive, validated through local compilation and testing pipelines. A novel multi-stage, context-aware prompting protocol simulates realistic debugging scenarios, while a graded rubric measures detection accuracy, reasoning depth, and remediation quality. Our results show that all models excel at identifying syntactic and semantic issues in well-scoped code, making them promising for educational use and as first-pass reviewers in automated code auditing. Performance diminishes in scenarios involving complex security vulnerabilities and large-scale production code, with ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3 generally providing more nuanced contextual analyses than LLaMA 4. This highlights both the promise and the present constraints of LLMs in serving as reliable code analysis tools.</p></details> |  |

Despite impressive progress on existing benchmarks, we argue that current evaluations overstate model proficiency, masking a substantial gap between LLMs and elite human programmers. This gap arises from two key limitations: insufficient difficulty and scope of benchmark problems, and evaluation bias from low-quality test cases. To address these shortcomings, we present AetherCode, a new benchmark that draws problems from premier programming competitions such as IOI and ICPC, offering broader coverage and higher difficulty. AetherCode further incorporates comprehensive, expert-validated test suites built through a hybrid of automated generation and human curation, ensuring rigorous and reliable assessment.

We consider Mealy machines that have stochastic delays associated with each transition and explore how the learner can efficiently arrive at faithful estimates of those machines, the precision of which crucially relies on repetitive sampling of transition delays. While it is possible to na\"ively integrate the delay sampling into AAL algorithms such as $L^*$, this leads to considerable oversampling near the root of the state space. We address this problem by separating conceptually the learning of behavior and delays such that the learner uses the information gained while learning the logical behavior to arrive at efficient input sequences for collecting the needed delay samples. We put emphasis on treating cases in which identical input/output behaviors might stem from distinct delay characteristics. Finally, we provide empirical evidence that our method outperforms the na\"ive baseline across a wide range of benchmarks and investigate its applicability in a realistic setting by studying the join order in a relational database.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Integrated Formal Methods (iFM) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Applications and Challenges of Fairness APIs in Machine Learning Software](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16377v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine Learning software systems are frequently used in our day-to-day lives. Some of these systems are used in various sensitive environments to make life-changing decisions. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that these AI/ML systems do not make any discriminatory decisions for any specific groups or populations. In that vein, different bias detection and mitigation open-source software libraries (aka API libraries) are being developed and used. In this paper, we conduct a qualitative study to understand in what scenarios these open-source fairness APIs are used in the wild, how they are used, and what challenges the developers of these APIs face while developing and adopting these libraries. We have analyzed 204 GitHub repositories (from a list of 1885 candidate repositories) which used 13 APIs that are developed to address bias in ML software. We found that these APIs are used for two primary purposes (i.e., learning and solving real-world problems), targeting 17 unique use-cases. Our study suggests that developers are not well-versed in bias detection and mitigation; they face lots of troubleshooting issues, and frequently ask for opinions and resources. Our findings can be instrumental for future bias-related software engineering research, and for guiding educators in developing more state-of-the-art curricula.</p></details> |  |
