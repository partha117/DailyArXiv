| **[The SWE-Bench Illusion: When State-of-the-Art LLMs Remember Instead of Reason](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12286v4)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly capable and widely adopted, benchmarks play a central role in assessing their practical utility. For example, SWE-Bench Verified has emerged as a critical benchmark for evaluating LLMs' software engineering abilities, particularly their aptitude for resolving real-world GitHub issues. Recent LLMs show impressive performance on SWE-Bench, leading to optimism about their capacity for complex coding tasks. However, current evaluation protocols may overstate these models' true capabilities. It is crucial to distinguish LLMs' generalizable problem-solving ability and other learned artifacts. In this work, we introduce two diagnostic tasks: file path identification from issue descriptions alone and ground truth function reproduction with only the current file context and issue description to probe models' underlying knowledge. We present empirical evidence that performance gains on SWE-Bench-Verified may be partially driven by memorization rather than genuine problem-solving. We show that state-of-the-art models achieve up to 76% accuracy in identifying buggy file paths using only issue descriptions, without access to repository structure. This performance is merely up to 53% on tasks from repositories not included in SWE-Bench, pointing to possible data contamination or memorization. Similar patterns are also observed for the function reproduction task, where the verbatim similarity is much higher on SWE-Bench Verified than on other similar coding benchmarks (up to 35% consecutive 5-gram accuracy on SWE-Bench Verified and Full, but only up to 18% for tasks in other benchmarks). These findings raise concerns about the validity of existing results and underscore the need for more robust, contamination-resistant benchmarks to reliably evaluate LLMs' coding abilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[A City upon a Hill: Casting Light on a Real Experimental Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12800v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: The overall scientific community is proposing measures to improve the reproducibility and replicability of experiments. Reproducibility is relatively easy to achieve. However, replicability is considerably more complex in both the sciences and Empirical Software Engineering (ESE). Several strategies, e.g., replication packages and families of experiments, have been proposed to improve replication in ESE, with limited success. We wonder whether the failures are due to some mismatch, i.e., the researchers' needs are not satisfied by the proposed replication procedures. Objectives: Find out how experimental researchers conduct \textit{experiments in practice}. Methods: We carried out an ethnography study within a SE Research Group. Our main activity was to observe/approach the experimental researchers in their day-to-day settings for two years. Their preferred literature and experimental materials were studied. We used individual and group interviews to gain understanding and examine unclear topics in-depth. Results: We have created conceptual and process models that represent how experimentation is really conducted in the Research Group. Models fit the community's procedures and terminology at a high level, but they become particular in their minute details. Conclusion: The actual experimental process differs from textbooks in several points, namely: (1) Number and diversity of activities, (2) existence of different roles, (3) the granularity of the concepts used by the roles, and (4) the viewpoints that different sub-areas or families of experiments have about the overall process.</p></details> |  |
| **[SmartC2Rust: Iterative, Feedback-Driven C-to-Rust Translation via Large Language Models for Safety and Equivalence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10506v3)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Memory safety vulnerabilities remain prevalent in today's software systems and one promising solution to mitigate them is to adopt memory-safe languages such as Rust. Due to legacy code written in memory unsafe C, there is strong motivation to translate legacy C code into Rust. Prior works have already shown promise in using Large Language Models (LLMs) for such translations. However, significant challenges persist for LLM-based translation: the translated code often fails to compile, let alone reduce unsafe statements and maintain the semantic functionalities due to inherent limitations of LLMs such as limited token size and inconsistent outputs. In this paper, we design an automated C-to-Rust translation system, called SmartC2Rust, to segment and convert the C code to Rust with memory safety and semantic equivalence. The key insight is to iteratively refine the output Rust code with additional feedback, e.g., compilation errors, segmentation contexts, semantic discrepancies, and memory unsafe statements. Such feedback will gradually improve the quality of generated Rust code, thus mitigating unsafety, inconsistency, and semantic issues. Our evaluation shows that SmartC2Rust significantly decreases the unsafe statements and outperforms prior works in security and semantic equivalence.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Study of Agent Developer Practices in AI Agent Frameworks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01939v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of large language models (LLMs) has sparked a surge of interest in agents, leading to the rapid growth of agent frameworks. Agent frameworks are software toolkits and libraries that provide standardized components, abstractions, and orchestration mechanisms to simplify agent development. Despite widespread use of agent frameworks, their practical applications and how they influence the agent development process remain underexplored. Different agent frameworks encounter similar problems during use, indicating that these recurring issues deserve greater attention and call for further improvements in agent framework design. Meanwhile, as the number of agent frameworks continues to grow and evolve, more than 80% of developers report difficulties in identifying the frameworks that best meet their specific development requirements. In this paper, we conduct the first empirical study of LLM-based agent frameworks, exploring real-world experiences of developers in building AI agents. To compare how well the agent frameworks meet developer needs, we further collect developer discussions for the ten previously identified agent frameworks, resulting in a total of 11,910 discussions. Finally, by analyzing these discussions, we compare the frameworks across five dimensions: development efficiency, functional abstraction, learning cost, performance optimization, and maintainability, which refers to how easily developers can update and extend both the framework itself and the agents built upon it over time. Our comparative analysis reveals significant differences among frameworks in how they meet the needs of agent developers. Overall, we provide a set of findings and implications for the LLM-driven AI agent framework ecosystem and offer insights for the design of future LLM-based agent frameworks and agent developers.</p></details> |  |
| **[LuGo: an Enhanced Quantum Phase Estimation Implementation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15439v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) is a cardinal algorithm in quantum computing that plays a crucial role in various applications, including cryptography, molecular simulation, and solving systems of linear equations. However, the standard implementation of QPE faces challenges related to time complexity and circuit depth, which limit its practicality for large-scale computations. We introduce LuGo, a novel framework designed to enhance the performance of QPE by reducing circuit duplication, as well as using parallelization techniques to achieve faster generation of the QPE circuit and gate reduction. We validate the effectiveness of our framework by generating quantum linear solver circuits, which require both QPE and inverse QPE, to solve linear systems of equations. LuGo achieves significant improvements in both computational efficiency and hardware requirements without compromising on accuracy. Compared to a standard QPE implementation, LuGo reduces time consumption to generate a circuit that solves a $2^6\times 2^6$ system matrix by a factor of $50.68$ and over $31\times$ reduction of quantum gates and circuit depth, with no fidelity loss on an ideal quantum simulator. We demonstrated the versatility and scalability of LuGo enabled HHL algorithm by simulating a canonical Hele-Shaw fluid problem using a quantum simulator. With these advantages, LuGo paves the way for more efficient implementations of QPE, enabling broader applications across several quantum computing domains.</p></details> |  |

While the field has evolved dramatically from rule-based systems to Transformer-based architectures, achieving performance improvements from single-digit to over 95\% success rates on benchmarks like HumanEval. In this work, we provide a comprehensive synthesis and practical guide (a series of analytic and probing experiments) about code LLMs, systematically examining the complete model life cycle from data curation to post-training through advanced prompting paradigms, code pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and autonomous coding agents. We analyze the code capability of the general LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA) and code-specialized LLMs (StarCoder, Code LLaMA, DeepSeek-Coder, and QwenCoder), critically examining the techniques, design decisions, and trade-offs. Further, we articulate the research-practice gap between academic research (e.g., benchmarks and tasks) and real-world deployment (e.g., software-related code tasks), including code correctness, security, contextual awareness of large codebases, and integration with development workflows, and map promising research directions to practical needs. Last, we conduct a series of experiments to provide a comprehensive analysis of code pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning, covering scaling law, framework selection, hyperparameter sensitivity, model architectures, and dataset comparisons.</p></details> |  |
| **[Web Element Relocalization in Evolving Web Applications: A Comparative Analysis and Extension Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16424v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fragile web tests, primarily caused by locator breakages, are a persistent challenge in web development. Hence, researchers have proposed techniques for web-element re-identification in which algorithms utilize a range of element properties to relocate elements on updated versions of websites based on similarity scoring. In this paper, we replicate the original studies of the most recent propositions in the literature, namely the Similo algorithm and its successor, VON Similo. We also acknowledge and reconsider assumptions related to threats to validity in the original studies, which prompted additional analysis and the development of mitigation techniques. Our analysis revealed that VON Similo, despite its novel approach, tends to produce more false positives than Similo. We mitigated these issues through algorithmic refinements and optimization algorithms that enhance parameters and comparison methods across all Similo variants, improving the accuracy of Similo on its original benchmark by 5.62%. Moreover, we extend the replicated studies by proposing a larger evaluation benchmark (23x bigger than the original study) as well as a novel approach that combines the strengths of both Similo and VON Similo, called HybridSimilo. The combined approach achieved a gain comparable to the improved Similo alone. Results on the extended benchmark show that HybridSimilo locates 98.8% of elements with broken locators in realistic testing scenarios.</p></details> |  |

The combined approach achieved a gain comparable to the improved Similo alone. Results on the extended benchmark show that HybridSimilo locates 98.8% of elements with broken locators in realistic testing scenarios.</p></details> |  |

| **[The SWE-Bench Illusion: When State-of-the-Art LLMs Remember Instead of Reason](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12286v4)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly capable and widely adopted, benchmarks play a central role in assessing their practical utility. For example, SWE-Bench Verified has emerged as a critical benchmark for evaluating LLMs' software engineering abilities, particularly their aptitude for resolving real-world GitHub issues. Recent LLMs show impressive performance on SWE-Bench, leading to optimism about their capacity for complex coding tasks. However, current evaluation protocols may overstate these models' true capabilities. It is crucial to distinguish LLMs' generalizable problem-solving ability and other learned artifacts. In this work, we introduce two diagnostic tasks: file path identification from issue descriptions alone and ground truth function reproduction with only the current file context and issue description to probe models' underlying knowledge. We present empirical evidence that performance gains on SWE-Bench-Verified may be partially driven by memorization rather than genuine problem-solving. We show that state-of-the-art models achieve up to 76% accuracy in identifying buggy file paths using only issue descriptions, without access to repository structure. This performance is merely up to 53% on tasks from repositories not included in SWE-Bench, pointing to possible data contamination or memorization. Similar patterns are also observed for the function reproduction task, where the verbatim similarity is much higher on SWE-Bench Verified than on other similar coding benchmarks (up to 35% consecutive 5-gram accuracy on SWE-Bench Verified and Full, but only up to 18% for tasks in other benchmarks). These findings raise concerns about the validity of existing results and underscore the need for more robust, contamination-resistant benchmarks to reliably evaluate LLMs' coding abilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[A City upon a Hill: Casting Light on a Real Experimental Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12800v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: The overall scientific community is proposing measures to improve the reproducibility and replicability of experiments. Reproducibility is relatively easy to achieve. However, replicability is considerably more complex in both the sciences and Empirical Software Engineering (ESE). Several strategies, e.g., replication packages and families of experiments, have been proposed to improve replication in ESE, with limited success. We wonder whether the failures are due to some mismatch, i.e., the researchers' needs are not satisfied by the proposed replication procedures. Objectives: Find out how experimental researchers conduct \textit{experiments in practice}. Methods: We carried out an ethnography study within a SE Research Group. Our main activity was to observe/approach the experimental researchers in their day-to-day settings for two years. Their preferred literature and experimental materials were studied. We used individual and group interviews to gain understanding and examine unclear topics in-depth. Results: We have created conceptual and process models that represent how experimentation is really conducted in the Research Group. Models fit the community's procedures and terminology at a high level, but they become particular in their minute details. Conclusion: The actual experimental process differs from textbooks in several points, namely: (1) Number and diversity of activities, (2) existence of different roles, (3) the granularity of the concepts used by the roles, and (4) the viewpoints that different sub-areas or families of experiments have about the overall process.</p></details> |  |

Due to legacy code written in memory unsafe C, there is strong motivation to translate legacy C code into Rust. Prior works have already shown promise in using Large Language Models (LLMs) for such translations. However, significant challenges persist for LLM-based translation: the translated code often fails to compile, let alone reduce unsafe statements and maintain the semantic functionalities due to inherent limitations of LLMs such as limited token size and inconsistent outputs. In this paper, we design an automated C-to-Rust translation system, called SmartC2Rust, to segment and convert the C code to Rust with memory safety and semantic equivalence. The key insight is to iteratively refine the output Rust code with additional feedback, e.g., compilation errors, segmentation contexts, semantic discrepancies, and memory unsafe statements. Such feedback will gradually improve the quality of generated Rust code, thus mitigating unsafety, inconsistency, and semantic issues. Our evaluation shows that SmartC2Rust significantly decreases the unsafe statements and outperforms prior works in security and semantic equivalence.</p></details> |  |

Agent frameworks are software toolkits and libraries that provide standardized components, abstractions, and orchestration mechanisms to simplify agent development. Despite widespread use of agent frameworks, their practical applications and how they influence the agent development process remain underexplored. Different agent frameworks encounter similar problems during use, indicating that these recurring issues deserve greater attention and call for further improvements in agent framework design. Meanwhile, as the number of agent frameworks continues to grow and evolve, more than 80% of developers report difficulties in identifying the frameworks that best meet their specific development requirements. In this paper, we conduct the first empirical study of LLM-based agent frameworks, exploring real-world experiences of developers in building AI agents. To compare how well the agent frameworks meet developer needs, we further collect developer discussions for the ten previously identified agent frameworks, resulting in a total of 11,910 discussions. Finally, by analyzing these discussions, we compare the frameworks across five dimensions: development efficiency, functional abstraction, learning cost, performance optimization, and maintainability, which refers to how easily developers can update and extend both the framework itself and the agents built upon it over time. Our comparative analysis reveals significant differences among frameworks in how they meet the needs of agent developers. Overall, we provide a set of findings and implications for the LLM-driven AI agent framework ecosystem and offer insights for the design of future LLM-based agent frameworks and agent developers.</p></details> |  |

However, the standard implementation of QPE faces challenges related to time complexity and circuit depth, which limit its practicality for large-scale computations. We introduce LuGo, a novel framework designed to enhance the performance of QPE by reducing circuit duplication, as well as using parallelization techniques to achieve faster generation of the QPE circuit and gate reduction. We validate the effectiveness of our framework by generating quantum linear solver circuits, which require both QPE and inverse QPE, to solve linear systems of equations. LuGo achieves significant improvements in both computational efficiency and hardware requirements without compromising on accuracy. Compared to a standard QPE implementation, LuGo reduces time consumption to generate a circuit that solves a $2^6\times 2^6$ system matrix by a factor of $50.68$ and over $31\times$ reduction of quantum gates and circuit depth, with no fidelity loss on an ideal quantum simulator. We demonstrated the versatility and scalability of LuGo enabled HHL algorithm by simulating a canonical Hele-Shaw fluid problem using a quantum simulator. With these advantages, LuGo paves the way for more efficient implementations of QPE, enabling broader applications across several quantum computing domains.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, we extend the replicated studies by proposing a larger evaluation benchmark (23x bigger than the original study) as well as a novel approach that combines the strengths of both Similo and VON Similo, called HybridSimilo. The combined approach achieved a gain comparable to the improved Similo alone. Results on the extended benchmark show that HybridSimilo locates 98.8% of elements with broken locators in realistic testing scenarios.</p></details> |  |

| **[The SWE-Bench Illusion: When State-of-the-Art LLMs Remember Instead of Reason](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12286v4)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly capable and widely adopted, benchmarks play a central role in assessing their practical utility. For example, SWE-Bench Verified has emerged as a critical benchmark for evaluating LLMs' software engineering abilities, particularly their aptitude for resolving real-world GitHub issues. Recent LLMs show impressive performance on SWE-Bench, leading to optimism about their capacity for complex coding tasks. However, current evaluation protocols may overstate these models' true capabilities. It is crucial to distinguish LLMs' generalizable problem-solving ability and other learned artifacts. In this work, we introduce two diagnostic tasks: file path identification from issue descriptions alone and ground truth function reproduction with only the current file context and issue description to probe models' underlying knowledge. We present empirical evidence that performance gains on SWE-Bench-Verified may be partially driven by memorization rather than genuine problem-solving. We show that state-of-the-art models achieve up to 76% accuracy in identifying buggy file paths using only issue descriptions, without access to repository structure. This performance is merely up to 53% on tasks from repositories not included in SWE-Bench, pointing to possible data contamination or memorization. Similar patterns are also observed for the function reproduction task, where the verbatim similarity is much higher on SWE-Bench Verified than on other similar coding benchmarks (up to 35% consecutive 5-gram accuracy on SWE-Bench Verified and Full, but only up to 18% for tasks in other benchmarks). These findings raise concerns about the validity of existing results and underscore the need for more robust, contamination-resistant benchmarks to reliably evaluate LLMs' coding abilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[A City upon a Hill: Casting Light on a Real Experimental Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12800v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: The overall scientific community is proposing measures to improve the reproducibility and replicability of experiments. Reproducibility is relatively easy to achieve. However, replicability is considerably more complex in both the sciences and Empirical Software Engineering (ESE). Several strategies, e.g., replication packages and families of experiments, have been proposed to improve replication in ESE, with limited success. We wonder whether the failures are due to some mismatch, i.e., the researchers' needs are not satisfied by the proposed replication procedures. Objectives: Find out how experimental researchers conduct \textit{experiments in practice}. Methods: We carried out an ethnography study within a SE Research Group. Our main activity was to observe/approach the experimental researchers in their day-to-day settings for two years. Their preferred literature and experimental materials were studied. We used individual and group interviews to gain understanding and examine unclear topics in-depth. Results: We have created conceptual and process models that represent how experimentation is really conducted in the Research Group. Models fit the community's procedures and terminology at a high level, but they become particular in their minute details. Conclusion: The actual experimental process differs from textbooks in several points, namely: (1) Number and diversity of activities, (2) existence of different roles, (3) the granularity of the concepts used by the roles, and (4) the viewpoints that different sub-areas or families of experiments have about the overall process.</p></details> |  |

Due to legacy code written in memory unsafe C, there is strong motivation to translate legacy C code into Rust. Prior works have already shown promise in using Large Language Models (LLMs) for such translations. However, significant challenges persist for LLM-based translation: the translated code often fails to compile, let alone reduce unsafe statements and maintain the semantic functionalities due to inherent limitations of LLMs such as limited token size and inconsistent outputs. In this paper, we design an automated C-to-Rust translation system, called SmartC2Rust, to segment and convert the C code to Rust with memory safety and semantic equivalence. The key insight is to iteratively refine the output Rust code with additional feedback, e.g., compilation errors, segmentation contexts, semantic discrepancies, and memory unsafe statements. Such feedback will gradually improve the quality of generated Rust code, thus mitigating unsafety, inconsistency, and semantic issues. Our evaluation shows that SmartC2Rust significantly decreases the unsafe statements and outperforms prior works in security and semantic equivalence.</p></details> |  |

Agent frameworks are software toolkits and libraries that provide standardized components, abstractions, and orchestration mechanisms to simplify agent development. Despite widespread use of agent frameworks, their practical applications and how they influence the agent development process remain underexplored. Different agent frameworks encounter similar problems during use, indicating that these recurring issues deserve greater attention and call for further improvements in agent framework design. Meanwhile, as the number of agent frameworks continues to grow and evolve, more than 80% of developers report difficulties in identifying the frameworks that best meet their specific development requirements. In this paper, we conduct the first empirical study of LLM-based agent frameworks, exploring real-world experiences of developers in building AI agents. To compare how well the agent frameworks meet developer needs, we further collect developer discussions for the ten previously identified agent frameworks, resulting in a total of 11,910 discussions. Finally, by analyzing these discussions, we compare the frameworks across five dimensions: development efficiency, functional abstraction, learning cost, performance optimization, and maintainability, which refers to how easily developers can update and extend both the framework itself and the agents built upon it over time. Our comparative analysis reveals significant differences among frameworks in how they meet the needs of agent developers. Overall, we provide a set of findings and implications for the LLM-driven AI agent framework ecosystem and offer insights for the design of future LLM-based agent frameworks and agent developers.</p></details> |  |

However, the standard implementation of QPE faces challenges related to time complexity and circuit depth, which limit its practicality for large-scale computations. We introduce LuGo, a novel framework designed to enhance the performance of QPE by reducing circuit duplication, as well as using parallelization techniques to achieve faster generation of the QPE circuit and gate reduction. We validate the effectiveness of our framework by generating quantum linear solver circuits, which require both QPE and inverse QPE, to solve linear systems of equations. LuGo achieves significant improvements in both computational efficiency and hardware requirements without compromising on accuracy. Compared to a standard QPE implementation, LuGo reduces time consumption to generate a circuit that solves a $2^6\times 2^6$ system matrix by a factor of $50.68$ and over $31\times$ reduction of quantum gates and circuit depth, with no fidelity loss on an ideal quantum simulator. We demonstrated the versatility and scalability of LuGo enabled HHL algorithm by simulating a canonical Hele-Shaw fluid problem using a quantum simulator. With these advantages, LuGo paves the way for more efficient implementations of QPE, enabling broader applications across several quantum computing domains.</p></details> |  |

We mitigated these issues through algorithmic refinements and optimization algorithms that enhance parameters and comparison methods across all Similo variants, improving the accuracy of Similo on its original benchmark by 5.62%. Moreover, we extend the replicated studies by proposing a larger evaluation benchmark (23x bigger than the original study) as well as a novel approach that combines the strengths of both Similo and VON Similo, called HybridSimilo. The combined approach achieved a gain comparable to the improved Similo alone. Results on the extended benchmark show that HybridSimilo locates 98.8% of elements with broken locators in realistic testing scenarios.</p></details> |  |

| **[The SWE-Bench Illusion: When State-of-the-Art LLMs Remember Instead of Reason](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12286v4)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly capable and widely adopted, benchmarks play a central role in assessing their practical utility. For example, SWE-Bench Verified has emerged as a critical benchmark for evaluating LLMs' software engineering abilities, particularly their aptitude for resolving real-world GitHub issues. Recent LLMs show impressive performance on SWE-Bench, leading to optimism about their capacity for complex coding tasks. However, current evaluation protocols may overstate these models' true capabilities. It is crucial to distinguish LLMs' generalizable problem-solving ability and other learned artifacts. In this work, we introduce two diagnostic tasks: file path identification from issue descriptions alone and ground truth function reproduction with only the current file context and issue description to probe models' underlying knowledge. We present empirical evidence that performance gains on SWE-Bench-Verified may be partially driven by memorization rather than genuine problem-solving. We show that state-of-the-art models achieve up to 76% accuracy in identifying buggy file paths using only issue descriptions, without access to repository structure. This performance is merely up to 53% on tasks from repositories not included in SWE-Bench, pointing to possible data contamination or memorization. Similar patterns are also observed for the function reproduction task, where the verbatim similarity is much higher on SWE-Bench Verified than on other similar coding benchmarks (up to 35% consecutive 5-gram accuracy on SWE-Bench Verified and Full, but only up to 18% for tasks in other benchmarks). These findings raise concerns about the validity of existing results and underscore the need for more robust, contamination-resistant benchmarks to reliably evaluate LLMs' coding abilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[A City upon a Hill: Casting Light on a Real Experimental Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12800v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: The overall scientific community is proposing measures to improve the reproducibility and replicability of experiments. Reproducibility is relatively easy to achieve. However, replicability is considerably more complex in both the sciences and Empirical Software Engineering (ESE). Several strategies, e.g., replication packages and families of experiments, have been proposed to improve replication in ESE, with limited success. We wonder whether the failures are due to some mismatch, i.e., the researchers' needs are not satisfied by the proposed replication procedures. Objectives: Find out how experimental researchers conduct \textit{experiments in practice}. Methods: We carried out an ethnography study within a SE Research Group. Our main activity was to observe/approach the experimental researchers in their day-to-day settings for two years. Their preferred literature and experimental materials were studied. We used individual and group interviews to gain understanding and examine unclear topics in-depth. Results: We have created conceptual and process models that represent how experimentation is really conducted in the Research Group. Models fit the community's procedures and terminology at a high level, but they become particular in their minute details. Conclusion: The actual experimental process differs from textbooks in several points, namely: (1) Number and diversity of activities, (2) existence of different roles, (3) the granularity of the concepts used by the roles, and (4) the viewpoints that different sub-areas or families of experiments have about the overall process.</p></details> |  |

Due to legacy code written in memory unsafe C, there is strong motivation to translate legacy C code into Rust. Prior works have already shown promise in using Large Language Models (LLMs) for such translations. However, significant challenges persist for LLM-based translation: the translated code often fails to compile, let alone reduce unsafe statements and maintain the semantic functionalities due to inherent limitations of LLMs such as limited token size and inconsistent outputs. In this paper, we design an automated C-to-Rust translation system, called SmartC2Rust, to segment and convert the C code to Rust with memory safety and semantic equivalence. The key insight is to iteratively refine the output Rust code with additional feedback, e.g., compilation errors, segmentation contexts, semantic discrepancies, and memory unsafe statements. Such feedback will gradually improve the quality of generated Rust code, thus mitigating unsafety, inconsistency, and semantic issues. Our evaluation shows that SmartC2Rust significantly decreases the unsafe statements and outperforms prior works in security and semantic equivalence.</p></details> |  |

Agent frameworks are software toolkits and libraries that provide standardized components, abstractions, and orchestration mechanisms to simplify agent development. Despite widespread use of agent frameworks, their practical applications and how they influence the agent development process remain underexplored. Different agent frameworks encounter similar problems during use, indicating that these recurring issues deserve greater attention and call for further improvements in agent framework design. Meanwhile, as the number of agent frameworks continues to grow and evolve, more than 80% of developers report difficulties in identifying the frameworks that best meet their specific development requirements. In this paper, we conduct the first empirical study of LLM-based agent frameworks, exploring real-world experiences of developers in building AI agents. To compare how well the agent frameworks meet developer needs, we further collect developer discussions for the ten previously identified agent frameworks, resulting in a total of 11,910 discussions. Finally, by analyzing these discussions, we compare the frameworks across five dimensions: development efficiency, functional abstraction, learning cost, performance optimization, and maintainability, which refers to how easily developers can update and extend both the framework itself and the agents built upon it over time. Our comparative analysis reveals significant differences among frameworks in how they meet the needs of agent developers. Overall, we provide a set of findings and implications for the LLM-driven AI agent framework ecosystem and offer insights for the design of future LLM-based agent frameworks and agent developers.</p></details> |  |

However, the standard implementation of QPE faces challenges related to time complexity and circuit depth, which limit its practicality for large-scale computations. We introduce LuGo, a novel framework designed to enhance the performance of QPE by reducing circuit duplication, as well as using parallelization techniques to achieve faster generation of the QPE circuit and gate reduction. We validate the effectiveness of our framework by generating quantum linear solver circuits, which require both QPE and inverse QPE, to solve linear systems of equations. LuGo achieves significant improvements in both computational efficiency and hardware requirements without compromising on accuracy. Compared to a standard QPE implementation, LuGo reduces time consumption to generate a circuit that solves a $2^6\times 2^6$ system matrix by a factor of $50.68$ and over $31\times$ reduction of quantum gates and circuit depth, with no fidelity loss on an ideal quantum simulator. We demonstrated the versatility and scalability of LuGo enabled HHL algorithm by simulating a canonical Hele-Shaw fluid problem using a quantum simulator. With these advantages, LuGo paves the way for more efficient implementations of QPE, enabling broader applications across several quantum computing domains.</p></details> |  |

Our analysis revealed that VON Similo, despite its novel approach, tends to produce more false positives than Similo. We mitigated these issues through algorithmic refinements and optimization algorithms that enhance parameters and comparison methods across all Similo variants, improving the accuracy of Similo on its original benchmark by 5.62%. Moreover, we extend the replicated studies by proposing a larger evaluation benchmark (23x bigger than the original study) as well as a novel approach that combines the strengths of both Similo and VON Similo, called HybridSimilo. The combined approach achieved a gain comparable to the improved Similo alone. Results on the extended benchmark show that HybridSimilo locates 98.8% of elements with broken locators in realistic testing scenarios.</p></details> |  |

| **[The SWE-Bench Illusion: When State-of-the-Art LLMs Remember Instead of Reason](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12286v4)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly capable and widely adopted, benchmarks play a central role in assessing their practical utility. For example, SWE-Bench Verified has emerged as a critical benchmark for evaluating LLMs' software engineering abilities, particularly their aptitude for resolving real-world GitHub issues. Recent LLMs show impressive performance on SWE-Bench, leading to optimism about their capacity for complex coding tasks. However, current evaluation protocols may overstate these models' true capabilities. It is crucial to distinguish LLMs' generalizable problem-solving ability and other learned artifacts. In this work, we introduce two diagnostic tasks: file path identification from issue descriptions alone and ground truth function reproduction with only the current file context and issue description to probe models' underlying knowledge. We present empirical evidence that performance gains on SWE-Bench-Verified may be partially driven by memorization rather than genuine problem-solving. We show that state-of-the-art models achieve up to 76% accuracy in identifying buggy file paths using only issue descriptions, without access to repository structure. This performance is merely up to 53% on tasks from repositories not included in SWE-Bench, pointing to possible data contamination or memorization. Similar patterns are also observed for the function reproduction task, where the verbatim similarity is much higher on SWE-Bench Verified than on other similar coding benchmarks (up to 35% consecutive 5-gram accuracy on SWE-Bench Verified and Full, but only up to 18% for tasks in other benchmarks). These findings raise concerns about the validity of existing results and underscore the need for more robust, contamination-resistant benchmarks to reliably evaluate LLMs' coding abilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[A City upon a Hill: Casting Light on a Real Experimental Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12800v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: The overall scientific community is proposing measures to improve the reproducibility and replicability of experiments. Reproducibility is relatively easy to achieve. However, replicability is considerably more complex in both the sciences and Empirical Software Engineering (ESE). Several strategies, e.g., replication packages and families of experiments, have been proposed to improve replication in ESE, with limited success. We wonder whether the failures are due to some mismatch, i.e., the researchers' needs are not satisfied by the proposed replication procedures. Objectives: Find out how experimental researchers conduct \textit{experiments in practice}. Methods: We carried out an ethnography study within a SE Research Group. Our main activity was to observe/approach the experimental researchers in their day-to-day settings for two years. Their preferred literature and experimental materials were studied. We used individual and group interviews to gain understanding and examine unclear topics in-depth. Results: We have created conceptual and process models that represent how experimentation is really conducted in the Research Group. Models fit the community's procedures and terminology at a high level, but they become particular in their minute details. Conclusion: The actual experimental process differs from textbooks in several points, namely: (1) Number and diversity of activities, (2) existence of different roles, (3) the granularity of the concepts used by the roles, and (4) the viewpoints that different sub-areas or families of experiments have about the overall process.</p></details> |  |
| **[SmartC2Rust: Iterative, Feedback-Driven C-to-Rust Translation via Large Language Models for Safety and Equivalence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10506v3)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Memory safety vulnerabilities remain prevalent in today's software systems and one promising solution to mitigate them is to adopt memory-safe languages such as Rust. Due to legacy code written in memory unsafe C, there is strong motivation to translate legacy C code into Rust. Prior works have already shown promise in using Large Language Models (LLMs) for such translations. However, significant challenges persist for LLM-based translation: the translated code often fails to compile, let alone reduce unsafe statements and maintain the semantic functionalities due to inherent limitations of LLMs such as limited token size and inconsistent outputs. In this paper, we design an automated C-to-Rust translation system, called SmartC2Rust, to segment and convert the C code to Rust with memory safety and semantic equivalence. The key insight is to iteratively refine the output Rust code with additional feedback, e.g., compilation errors, segmentation contexts, semantic discrepancies, and memory unsafe statements. Such feedback will gradually improve the quality of generated Rust code, thus mitigating unsafety, inconsistency, and semantic issues. Our evaluation shows that SmartC2Rust significantly decreases the unsafe statements and outperforms prior works in security and semantic equivalence.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Study of Agent Developer Practices in AI Agent Frameworks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01939v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of large language models (LLMs) has sparked a surge of interest in agents, leading to the rapid growth of agent frameworks. Agent frameworks are software toolkits and libraries that provide standardized components, abstractions, and orchestration mechanisms to simplify agent development. Despite widespread use of agent frameworks, their practical applications and how they influence the agent development process remain underexplored. Different agent frameworks encounter similar problems during use, indicating that these recurring issues deserve greater attention and call for further improvements in agent framework design. Meanwhile, as the number of agent frameworks continues to grow and evolve, more than 80% of developers report difficulties in identifying the frameworks that best meet their specific development requirements. In this paper, we conduct the first empirical study of LLM-based agent frameworks, exploring real-world experiences of developers in building AI agents. To compare how well the agent frameworks meet developer needs, we further collect developer discussions for the ten previously identified agent frameworks, resulting in a total of 11,910 discussions. Finally, by analyzing these discussions, we compare the frameworks across five dimensions: development efficiency, functional abstraction, learning cost, performance optimization, and maintainability, which refers to how easily developers can update and extend both the framework itself and the agents built upon it over time. Our comparative analysis reveals significant differences among frameworks in how they meet the needs of agent developers. Overall, we provide a set of findings and implications for the LLM-driven AI agent framework ecosystem and offer insights for the design of future LLM-based agent frameworks and agent developers.</p></details> |  |
| **[LuGo: an Enhanced Quantum Phase Estimation Implementation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15439v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) is a cardinal algorithm in quantum computing that plays a crucial role in various applications, including cryptography, molecular simulation, and solving systems of linear equations. However, the standard implementation of QPE faces challenges related to time complexity and circuit depth, which limit its practicality for large-scale computations. We introduce LuGo, a novel framework designed to enhance the performance of QPE by reducing circuit duplication, as well as using parallelization techniques to achieve faster generation of the QPE circuit and gate reduction. We validate the effectiveness of our framework by generating quantum linear solver circuits, which require both QPE and inverse QPE, to solve linear systems of equations. LuGo achieves significant improvements in both computational efficiency and hardware requirements without compromising on accuracy. Compared to a standard QPE implementation, LuGo reduces time consumption to generate a circuit that solves a $2^6\times 2^6$ system matrix by a factor of $50.68$ and over $31\times$ reduction of quantum gates and circuit depth, with no fidelity loss on an ideal quantum simulator. We demonstrated the versatility and scalability of LuGo enabled HHL algorithm by simulating a canonical Hele-Shaw fluid problem using a quantum simulator. With these advantages, LuGo paves the way for more efficient implementations of QPE, enabling broader applications across several quantum computing domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Code Foundation Models to Agents and Applications: A Practical Guide to Code Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18538v2)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have fundamentally transformed automated software development by enabling direct translation of natural language descriptions into functional code, driving commercial adoption through tools like Github Copilot (Microsoft), Cursor (Anysphere), Trae (ByteDance), and Claude Code (Anthropic). While the field has evolved dramatically from rule-based systems to Transformer-based architectures, achieving performance improvements from single-digit to over 95\% success rates on benchmarks like HumanEval. In this work, we provide a comprehensive synthesis and practical guide (a series of analytic and probing experiments) about code LLMs, systematically examining the complete model life cycle from data curation to post-training through advanced prompting paradigms, code pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and autonomous coding agents. We analyze the code capability of the general LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA) and code-specialized LLMs (StarCoder, Code LLaMA, DeepSeek-Coder, and QwenCoder), critically examining the techniques, design decisions, and trade-offs. Further, we articulate the research-practice gap between academic research (e.g., benchmarks and tasks) and real-world deployment (e.g., software-related code tasks), including code correctness, security, contextual awareness of large codebases, and integration with development workflows, and map promising research directions to practical needs. Last, we conduct a series of experiments to provide a comprehensive analysis of code pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning, covering scaling law, framework selection, hyperparameter sensitivity, model architectures, and dataset comparisons.</p></details> |  |

Hence, researchers have proposed techniques for web-element re-identification in which algorithms utilize a range of element properties to relocate elements on updated versions of websites based on similarity scoring. In this paper, we replicate the original studies of the most recent propositions in the literature, namely the Similo algorithm and its successor, VON Similo. We also acknowledge and reconsider assumptions related to threats to validity in the original studies, which prompted additional analysis and the development of mitigation techniques.
